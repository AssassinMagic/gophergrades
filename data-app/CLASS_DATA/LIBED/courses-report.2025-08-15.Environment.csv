"AFRO","1131","Contemporary Issues in Africa","Twin Cities","While issues in Africa have been discussed widely, little attention is given to what African nations have achieved since their independence. The course critically questions the generally pessimistic international viewpoint on African economic prospects and emphasizes some of the continent’s national successes. This course examines the factors underlying contemporary issues in the continent, discussing Africa’s major challenges, including climate change, problems related to extractive industries, the brain drain, illicit capital flight, and the burden of debt. It outlines how challenges such as the migration of professionals and extractive industries could be turned into opportunities to transform the continent’s educational and health sectors and improve revenue at local levels by looking at case studies in which these problems have been at least partially overcome. The course uses data derived from cultural anthropology, geography, political sciences, and economics.

"AFRO","3013","Cities and States in Ancient Africa","Twin Cities","In this course, students will learn about the nexus between society and the environment, the underlining environmental issues that transformed ancient cities, and the implications they have on the contemporary ecological problems Africa is facing. The continent is endowed with a hugely diverse environment, ranging from desert to equatorial rainforest, as well as diverse cultures. Africa's various natural and cultural environments have played a part in shaping human activities, including agriculture, trade, and technology—which in turn have shaped the nature of the cities and states that have emerged across the continent. Technological innovations such as irrigation have allowed complex societies to develop and grow in an otherwise inhospitable desert climate with limited natural resources. Although the prevalence of animal diseases and all-year-round rainfall restricted surplus agricultural production by affecting the use of animals as a source of draft power and cultivation of cereal crops, advances in technology, including ironwork and adoption of the tropical rainforest crops, facilitated the transformation of the physical environment and emergence of cities and states in the rainforest. The course examines how the nature of early agriculture, the environment, and technology shaped the history of African societies to equip learners with a better understanding of the contemporary social and environmental challenges. It assesses the dynamism in the relation between African societies and the environment over time.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Periodic Fall, Spring & Summer"

‘Food Sovereignty in Africa’ critically evaluates how the physical environment and historical processes  shaped agricultural productivity in Africa, as well as exploring the subsequent relationship the  continent has had with the rest of the world. The course uses multi-disciplinary resources to examine historical factors that have contributed to contemporary food security issues, and discusses  grassroots food movements that embrace the ethics and values of African societies in their efforts to  achieve both food security and environmental sustainability. It also examines the interplay between  food security, indigenous knowledge, and environmental sustainability by comparing various  standpoints on African food production, scrutinizing the challenges the continent is facing and the  unique perspectives it offers in terms of agricultural development in the globalized world. Finally, the  course examines how agricultural systems in Africa are affected by the new global land rush. After  taking the course, students will have better knowledge of emerging research directions on Africa and  will be equipped with sufficient research and practical skills to pursue independent studies beyond the  classroom.

Where and how these plants are produced is determined by soil, weather, natural biodiversity, and human culture. In turn, agricultural production of plants shapes the natural environment and society. This class will provide students with an overview of crop production including the history of agriculture, food chemistry, and plant growth and physiology as it relates to agriculture. Students will evaluate crop production practices in terms of their economic, social, and environmental outcomes, and highlight tradeoffs and synergies among these outcomes.

"AMES","1256","Movies for Earth: Asia and the Environment","Twin Cities","This course offers an opportunity to contemplate our ecological future as a planet through film. Movies can change how we think and act for the purposes of environmental justice. In this course, we will examine ecological changes that have occurred over decades of habitat loss and climate change, and the reasons for the radical changes in our ecologies and how movies made in Asia interpret these impacts. We will watch and discuss popular and indie Asian films that address social and environmental precarity through the lens of various Asia-related landscapes, cities, people, and creatures. The UN Environmental Program reports that the Asia-Pacific is “the fastest-growing economic powerhouse in the world. This strong economic growth has lifted about 1 billion people out of extreme poverty since the turn of the century. It is home to 60% of the world’s total population and 70% of the world’s most populous cities [...]. However, the region’s resource-intensive growth has come at a high price and poses a significant threat to people’s well-being and the environment.” In this course, students will analyze the relationship of people to places and impacts on various environments and their denizens as a result of historical events, technological innovation, and cultural beliefs.

At the same time, we will examine the ways in which film technologies, film styles, and film genres impact how we think about social and ecopolitical issues. How does the medium convey the message? With each film, we will examine a different genre or film style and how it contributes to the ways in which environmental and cultural issues get framed. In other words, in this course students will explore environmental issues in Asia while also exploring the relevance of representation in addressing contemporary issues involving human and non-human denizens, culture, and ecopolitics. 

Finally, we will address the science behind these environmental issues. Scientific concepts to be explored include bioaccumulation and biomagnification in water bodies in East Asia; nuclear technology and its promises and politicization in East Asia; the role of dams in modernity and their impacts on places and people; the contribution of cement to CO2 emissions and new forms of cement being explored; how climate change manifests in distinct Asian territories—the mitigation practices for flooding and mudslides; fish protein as cultural food and its impact; the role of elephants in Asian culture; the use of trail cams in environmental biology; planned obsolescence and plastics and their impact in China; the role of popular culture including anime and social media in making change, and many other topics.

"ARTH","3434","Art and the Environment","Twin Cities","Western art has a long tradition of depicting and directly engaging with the environment—from ancient earthworks such as Stonehenge and Avebury Stone Circle, to 18th and 19th century landscape paintings and 20th century photographs, to land and earth art of the 1960s and ‘70s, and what is now called environmental or eco art. Such art has had a prominent place in art’s history, but do we really need art to save the environment? Studies repeatedly show that the arts are crucial to understanding and forestalling environmental disaster because, it turns out, human attitudes are shaped by the stories we tell, by our ability to imagine the unimaginable, to accept the inanimate as potentially coming to life, to picture things on a vast scale. In this course students learn the historical development of artistic movements from 1968, when the first exhibition of such art, called “Earthworks,” took place at the Dwan Gallery in New York, up to the present day. The course tracks the changing aesthetic, political, and climatic forces that influenced such art, from the anti-institutionalism and participatory approaches of the 1960s to the more activist artistic engagement with environmentalism today. The class takes up two primary concerns: understanding the historical and scientific conditions that have given rise to such art and learning the ways in which artists have sought to intervene in and affect a changing environment. Students put historical knowledge, environmental research, and visual analysis skills to work in a culminating group project creating art that responds to a contemporary environmental problem.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Periodic Fall & Spring"

"CFAN","3527","Chile: Natural History of Patagonia","Twin Cities","Co-production of sustainable knowledge: An exploration of human-wildlife conflict and a community artistic expression in southern Chile

Conservation biology addresses the tradeoffs inherent in balancing human needs for extractable ecosystem goods and services with our need for biodiversity and natural conditions. Our discussions always include the biophysical science of ecosystems and the human resource science of decisions. This class engages you directly in understanding and communicating about sustainable resource management in Patagonia, the fabulously beautiful, highly diverse, end-of-the-word in South America. You will explore mountainous and marine landscapes, places where you will (at least hope to see) Elephant seals, Mountain Lions, Emperor Penguins, Guanacos, and Patagonian Foxes. You also will encounter invasive rabbits and beavers, gigantic salmon aquaculture opens and an open pit mine. You will work with local community members to develop a permanent mural depicting all that. And you wll work with peers to develop a video documenting your experience.

Humans have inhabited Patagonia for at last 14,000 years. For thousands of years, the nomadic Aónikenk people were the principal humans in the landscape. The technologically superior Mapuche people were predominant during the 1500s; Europeans (primarily Spanish and English) colonized the area from the mid-1500s; Chile has been an independent country since 1826. The economy of the area has been dominated by mining and agriculture. Mining extracts minerals and low quality coal. Agriculture includes sheep ranching as well as large scale marine salmon aquaculture. Sheep ranching resulted in thousands of miles of barbed wire fence, and millions of hectares of degraded grasslands, with associated negative impacts on wildlife. Wool prices were strong from the late 1800s through the mid 1950s, then dropped precipitously. As a result, many sheep estnacias were abandoned or turned into tourist lodges. Patagonia today is a land of expansive landscapes of mountains, grasslands, glaciers and high altitude lakes. The wildlife characteristic of the area include all Guanacos (a South American camel), the Huemel deer, Patagonian fox, hog nosed skunk and Andean Condor. Native marine life include penguins, elephant seals, leopard seals, and the Patagonian skate.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Spring"

In other words, we are currently facing a biodiversity crisis with threats to the Earth's biota not seen since the dinosaurs perished 65 million years ago. ""Biodiversity"" was coined by W.G. Rosen and E.O. Wilson in the 1980s to describe the variation in all of life on Earth. The term is now widely used in both the scientific and popular literature and is at the center of scientific enquiry, conservation efforts, large-scale collaborative pursuits of technological advances to allow monitoring from space, and global assessments that interface with international policy. Biodiversity requires integration across multiple disciplines from evolution, to ecology, remote sensing, conservation biology, economics and the social sciences, including environmental policy. Biodiversity science is thus inherently interdisciplinary. As a consequence, rarely does a single course provide students the opportunity to focus on this critical topic from multiple perspectives and dimensions.
This course seeks to provide students intensive study of biodiversity from six perspectives: 1) the origins of biodiversity, including the processes of speciation and extinction over macroevolutionary timescales and those involved in generating biological variation at microevolutionary scales; 2) the ecological problem of species coexistence, given the nature of competitive interactions and biological filters with a focus on the interactions of individual species and major threats to biodiversity; 3) the consequences of biodiversity and biodiversity loss for ecosystem functions, focusing on ecosystem scale processes; 4) the services or benefits to humans attributed to biodiversity, including cultural benefits of biodiversity; here we discuss both practical and ethical arguments for sustaining biodiversity; 5) methods of detecting biodiversity including classic field biodiversity observations and taxonomic collections and emerging remote sensing methods that harness hyperspectral data and satellite imagery; and 6) scientific assessments of biodiversity that communicate the science of biodiversity to policymakers, particularly the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).

"ESCI","1902","Minnesota's Water","Twin Cities","This course addresses important societal questions, such as ""Where does my drinking water come from? Do I really need to buy bottled water? What should my stand be regarding major water-related environmental issues in Minnesota?"" In this course, we will explore the world around us, and apply what we learn to better contribute to the solutions we will need as a society to deal with impacts on water quality and quantity due to factors such as agriculture, flood control, groundwater pumping, hydroelectric power, integrity of surface water features, inter basin transfers, invasive biota, mining, and shipping. In doing so, we will explore ways for everyone to better take responsibility for their role in optimizing public health, maximizing economic benefits, maintaining biodiversity, and protecting the integrity of surface water features on our landscape. 

Emphasis will be placed on how our choices and solutions will in the long term affect our principal drinking water source--the groundwater that is hosted in ancient rocks in the north and in the deep subsurface, younger limestone and sandstone in the south, and the sediments of the most recent Ice Age from which our soils have formed. A full-day field trip planned for a Saturday in September will examine how societal choices affect our use of and protection of water resources in our rivers and lakes, and a second full-day trip on a Saturday in October will address the same issues in relation to our largest source of drinking water--our wells. Those unable to attend a field trip may instead prepare a paper. ","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","001475","Every Fall"
"ESCI","1911","Designing solutions to environmental problems","Twin Cities","Professor Andy Wickert studies our landscapes to tell the stories of their pasts and to forecast their futures. To do this, he makes field observations, writes code for computer models, and designs and builds open-source instrumentation.

They are the microbial predators that cause disease. Infectious disease has devastated human populations and even caused global population declines. Subduing and managing disease is one of the grand challenges of our time. Through an enormous global effort, we have driven smallpox in humans and Rinderpest in livestock extinct from the natural world, and guinea worm is expected to follow. Other infectious diseases are in continual decline. In this course we will combine ecological thought and ecological models with historical and future perspectives to understand the fundamental dynamics of our miniscule predators, and relate this to similar miniscule predators of wild and domestic animals, to crops, and to other plants.

"GCC","3032","Ecosystem Health: Leadership at the Intersection of Humans, Animals, and the Environment","Twin Cities","What are the effects of climate change, disease emergence, food and water security, gender, conflict and poverty, and sustainability of ecosystem services on health, and how do we lead across boundaries for positive change? Unfortunately, these large-scale problems often become overwhelming, making single solution-based progress seem daunting and difficult to implement in policy. Fortunately, the emerging discipline of ecosystem health provides an approach to these problems grounded in trans-disciplinary science. Ecosystem health recognizes the interdependence of human, animal and environmental health, and merges theories and methods of ecological, health and political sciences. It poses that health threats can be prevented, monitored and controlled via a variety of approaches and technologies that guide management action as well as policy. Thus, balancing human and animal health with the management of our ecosystems. In this class, we will focus on the emerging discipline of ecosystem health, and how these theories, methods, and shared leadership approaches set the stage for solutions to grand challenges of health at the interface of humans, animals, and the environment. We will focus not only on the creation and evaluation of solutions but on their feasibility and implementation in the real world through policy and real-time decision making. This will be taught in the active learning style classroom, requiring pre-class readings to support didactic theory and case-based learning in class. Participation and both individual and group projects (written and oral presentation) will comprise most of the student evaluation. These projects may reflect innovative solutions, discoveries about unknowns, or development of methods useful for ecosystem health challenges. We envision that some of them will lead to peer-review publications, technical reports, or other forms of publication.

"GCC","3041","Transition to a Sustainable World: Can Behavior Modification Help Facilitate Global Sustainability?","Twin Cities","Despite understanding the consequences of not acting to curb unsustainability, why do people fail to act? Human’s behavioral apathy toward sustainability may be due to an inaccurate characterization of sustainability and/or a lack of understanding of cultural diversity and behavior. Therefore, an understanding of the human behavior will contribute greatly to (i) decipher human actions that negatively impact global ecosystems, (ii) slowdown or stop human ecologically destructive trajectory, and (iii) promote sustainable alternatives. The problem is that environmental issues are not generally included in psychology programs, and psychology is not often represented in environmental programs. In the United Nation’s (UN) Sustainable Development goals 2030 (UN SDG 2030), psychological indices have been conspicuously absent (except for mental health in general terms) even though environmental degradation, social or economic inequity, all are implicated by human behavior. The UN SDG 2030 is based on the unproven concept that sustainability is an intersection of social, economic and environmental factors, the key pillars of sustainability. Since economic activity and society are subsets of human behavior, psychology should be considered central to unsustainability and/or sustainability. Therefore, we hypothesize that behavioral psychology has a critical role to play in creating a sustainable society. The aim of the proposed GCC is to discuss (un)sustainability using this new paradigm that will allow new approaches to achieve transition from unsustainability to sustainability worldwide. The specific aims of the proposed GCC are following: (i) Describe interaction between sustainability and behavioral psychology as the 4th pillar of sustainability. (ii) Explain the behavioral correlates of cultural differences in terms of transition to sustainability. (iii) Explain the consumption (related to unsustainability) and conservation (related to sustainability) behavior. (iv) Determine the place of Psychology in the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that are mostly based on Sociology, Economy and Environment.

"GEOG","1425","Introduction to Weather and Climate","Twin Cities","Weather is part of our everyday lives, sometimes memorably so, such as when we experience snow storms, thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, or heat waves. Our society also increasingly is concerned about environmental issues such as air quality, environmental health, and climate change, which have a fundamental atmospheric component. What do we know about how the atmosphere works? How might our own actions affect weather and climate? This class will help to answer those questions. In this course you'll learn about the science of the atmosphere. You will be introduced to fundamental principles governing weather and climate, such as energy transfer and atmospheric motion, and learn how they relate to weather phenomena you observe in the environment. You will collect and analyze weather data and weather maps, and make use of many of the same tools used by professional weather forecasters. Lab write-ups include narrative as well as statistical and graphical analyses, and will help you develop or refine your analytical and critical thinking skills.
You will also consider how weather and climate topics relate to debates around environmental issues, particularly those related to the atmosphere (such as climate change, the ozone hole, and air pollution). It is not necessary that we agree about what should be “done” about human impacts on the atmosphere; rather, our goal in this course is to understand the interactions and possible effects of human activity and to consider our roles as agents of environmental change.","4","4","No","1","4","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Fall & Spring"

This course examines how our world’s economic and political systems, and the livelihoods they engender in the Global South, have produced catastrophic local and global environmental conditions. What we produce, sell, buy, how we consume goods, and how we dispose of the waste are at the heart of the world’s deteriorating environmental conditions. The current global world order has produced a world in which overconsumption and poverty have led to an environmental disaster that is endangering all species. Example of the topics we will explore include the state of global fisheries and forests, the struggle over scarce water resources, and the responsibility each of us has as an individual and a citizen in reversing the lone planet’s ability to support the lives of all humans and other species.

Human societies have long been embedded in physical landscapes where they are subject to specific environmental conditions and physical risks: eight thousand-year-old wall paintings in Turkey depict the eruption of Hasan Dag volcano over the city of Catal Huyuk, for example. But then and now, it takes a certain combination of social conditions and environmental events to create a natural disaster. In this course, we will use historical natural disasters to explore the interconnections between the structures and ideas of human society and environmental forces. Humans have not been simply the random victims of natural disasters; where and how they chose to live influenced the impact of any disastrous event. Examining these events in a historical context will help us see the social, technological, scientific, and environmental systems that have been constantly interacting, but which are normally taken for granted until they break down.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Periodic Spring"
"HSEM","2231H","How ‘Green’ is ‘Green’ Energy: Environmental Protection vs Sustainable Energy Initiatives","Twin Cities","Northern Minnesota has long been an area of interest for both its natural beauty and its mineral resources. Prior to colonization, it was home to the Anishinaabeg. Today, northern Minnesota is home to a diverse community and environment that includes Indigenous Nations, a thriving tourist industry, the Boundary Waters Canoe Area, and mining companies. Currently, there is intense debate around the establishment of new mines in northern Minnesota to exploit the metals necessary for the manufacturing of technology, specifically the metals needed to sustain green energy initiatives. This seminar will address the question ""How green is green energy"" by exploring the delicate balance among resource availability, societal energy needs, ethical land management, and ultimately climate change and long-term sustainability. To gain perspective on this complicated balance we will first learn about the Earth System, climate change, and energy resources. We will then review the geologic processes that formed mineral resources in northern Minnesota and how the exploitation of these resources has impacted local cultures and economies. The last part of the semester will focus on the current debate about mining in northern Minnesota and the broader framework of sustainable energy. 

Through readings and discussions, you will gain an appreciation for the multidisciplinary and multicultural perspectives related to human interactions with our environment, energy needs, and the importance of effective communication.","3","3","No","1","3","A-F - A-F Grade Basis","000571","Periodic Fall & Spring"
"HSEM","2540H","Understanding the Russian Land","Twin Cities","Encompassing more than 6.5 million square miles, Russia is an immense and ecologically diverse country. The environment of the frigid and heavily forested heartland of early Russian civilization, as well as that of the ""wild field"" (the Eurasian steppe) on its border, have posed a series of challenges to Russians and have left an indelible mark on modern Russian culture.  In this interdisciplinary seminar, we will study how Russians have conceived of and used nature from the medieval period to the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Articulating a particular approach to nature has been integral to several ideological and cultural projects in Russian history, including the formation of a literary tradition, the establishment of a multi-ethnic empire encompassing several biomes, and the development of a vision of Soviet science conquering and reshaping nature and the world. In the period we will study (the fifteenth century to 1991 Russia) underwent several profound epistemological shifts, and a particular focus of this course will be how the ways Russians created natural knowledge changed over time. Knowledge is power, and we will study how natural knowledge was used to strengthen and expand the state in the medieval, imperial, and Soviet periods. Another major focus of this course is the ravages that nature and humankind have inflicted on one another, and we will study how the environment influenced the development of Russia's form of agricultural slavery, serfdom, as well as the history of environmental degradation, including deforestation, the establishment of heavy industry, and nuclear disaster.","3","3","No","1","3","A-F - A-F Grade Basis","000571","Periodic Spring"
"HSEM","2637H","Small but Impactful: Insects and the Environment","Twin Cities","Harvard biologist E. O. Wilson referred to insects and other invertebrates as the ‘little things that run the world’. Insects may be small but are numerous, diverse and present almost everywhere – as humans we encounter them not matter where we are and what we do!  In this course, Honors students and the Instructor will jointly explore influences of insects as pollinators, ‘recyclers’, and as invasive species that lead to environmental pollution; adaptations that enable insects to handle diverse environmental conditions including climate change; and impacts on humans of insects on planet earth.  

The course will include brief interactive lectures, select readings and videos for providing background and context related to a specific topic. Students will then explore each topic by engaging in open conversations, small/large discussions using active learning approaches such as think-pair-share, jigsaw discussion groups, and debates for sharing their perspectives based on individual backgrounds/major/interests.

"HSEM","3071H","People, Pines, and Fire: Shaping the forested landscapes of Minnesota and the Great Lakes","Twin Cities","Wildland fire as an agent of renewal, vegetation change, and maintenance has been a critical process in the pine forests of the Upper Great Lakes. The vast pineries, so sought after by settler-colonialists as a commodity evolved over millennia with fire. Fires were both ‘natural’, ignited by lightning strikes, and fire was applied judiciously by Native American groups to manage landscapes and improve resources. It was an act of reciprocity: carefully tending the land to keep it healthy, while utilizing resources in return. However, the advent of effective fire suppression to protect forests first as a commodity and later for recreational enjoyment has led to substantial changes in forest communities while at the same time erasing an important cultural activity from the landscape. This seminar course explores the deep connections between fire and the emergence of Great Lakes forests, as well as the cultural use of fire as a tool. In this course, we will explore the development of effective fire suppression, the emergence of fortress-ecology/conservation, and the impacts of reduced fire activity on forest resilience. We will also discuss the concept of ‘wilderness’ and traditional ecological knowledge and the relationship with fire management today, particularly within the framework of a changing climate. This course is meant to merge interdisciplinary topics in ecology, climatology, and geography to explore the important connections between humans and their physical environment in the Upper Great Lakes pine landscapes. The course will be discussion based with frequent visits from resource professionals and the instructor’s Indigenous research collaborators.","3","3","No","1","3","A-F - A-F Grade Basis","000571","Periodic Fall"
"HSEM","3241H","Human Impacts on Earth's Natural Resources","Twin Cities","Humans' ability to be sustainable and live in harmony with nature is being challenged by their uncontrolled consumption of natural resources leading to resource scarcity, social conflicts, and other destabilizing social pressures. It is hypothesized that a failure by humans to change course will put the Earth's inhabitants on track to severe and potentially catastrophic implications. The support for the hypothesis comes from the pioneering work of Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen and others, arguing that all natural resources are irreversibly degraded when put to use in economic activity. Paul Ehrlich, in his bet with Julian Simon, had an opposing perspective that resource depletion may not be a problem for the future of humanity. Others said the following: ""We write with the conviction that knowledge and technology, applied with wisdom, might allow for a good, or even great, Anthropocene.""

These statements provide evidence both in support of and against the hypothesis. Students registered for this course will learn resource consumption dynamics and distribution from both perspectives. The information presented in this course will be valuable to the policymakers, stakeholders, and administrators working with human resource consumption. The specific aims are the following:
(1) Introduce the distribution and regulation of Earth's natural resources.
(2)	Explain the human pressures that decouple resource consumption from resource regeneration (in support of the hypothesis). 
(3)	Discuss the social aspects of resource consumption in the Anthropocene (against the hypothesis).
(4)	Work on Group research projects based on the opposing views of resource consumption.","3","3","No","1","3","A-F - A-F Grade Basis","000571","Periodic Fall & Spring"
"HSEM","3705H","Nanotechnology: A Blessing or Curse to Society","Twin Cities","Despite extensive commercial applications, a clear understanding of the adverse effects of Engineered Nanoparticles (ENPs) is lacking. A survey of the literature indicated the available information to be incomplete, independently unverified, and some may have been over-interpreted. Deep uncertainties currently pervade every step of the risk assessment of ENPs, making the procedure incapable of properly serving its purpose. The current conventional risk assessment strategies are not applicable for ENPs because of their unique properties and toxicity that may not conform to the norms of classic toxicology laws. Therefore, implementing some non-conventional tools in the risk assessment framework may be needed to reduce uncertainties and deliver accurate risk characterization of ENPs. This would enable current regulation to adequately reflect the risks of ENPs and protect the environment and the community. Therefore, the students registered for this seminar will learn some general features of ENPs, how the general public might be exposed to ENPs, and their potential health effects so that they can make an informed decision regarding the safe use of ENPs. With a serious information gap regarding ENPs safety, whether ENPs are a blessing or a curse is debatable. ","3","3","No","1","3","A-F - A-F Grade Basis","000571","Periodic Fall"
