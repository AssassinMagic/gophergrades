"AFRO","3205","History of South Africa from 1910: Anti-Racism, Youth Politics, Pandemics & Gender (Based Violence)","Twin Cities","We are all living in extraordinary times. But what does that mean? In South Africa, we have seen the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures implemented to control it causing massive social upheaval and personal distress. It has forced the people in the country to confront issues that life prior to the pandemic had made easy to turn away from. Misogyny, gender based violence, and sexual violence, a long-standing emergency in the south of Africa, have been forced into our vision once again. It was not the pandemic that created this violence. Nor was it the first time people had been outraged by a lack of action to address it. In the years approaching 2020, calls, protests and demonstrations were increasingly demanding the culture of impunity in gender based violence be ended; sometime with violent outcomes against the protestors themselves. Over those same years, nationwide protests have rocked South Africa's university campuses. The student movements known as #RhodesMustFall, #FeesMustFall and #RUReferenceList highlight the contrasts and disappointments of the recent past in South Africa, confront the legacy of racism and misogyny in its institutions and knowledge systems, and resonate with a history of anti-racism and struggle that now, in turn, similarly fuel the on-going Black Lives Matter and #MeToo movements worldwide.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Periodic Fall"

Her work has been influential in ancient Near Eastern and Mediterranean studies when dealing with issues of sacred/profane, purity/pollution, and ritual sacrifice and purification. Douglas' work provides a framework within which to understand ancients' thinking about these concepts that range from the sacredness of space and bodies to perceived pollutions cause by bodily leakage or liminal stages of life and death.  In this course, we will examine Douglas' theory in light of ancient evidence, with special attention to anceint Israelite literature (the Tanakh or Old Testament) and ancient Jewish literature (the Dead Sea Scrolls), but we will also analyze other ancient Near Eastern and Mediterranean examples of purity and pollution (from epigraphical and documentary evidence).","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Spring"

No background in the time period or discipline is expected and therefore this class will also serve as an introduction to interdisciplinary study of art history and the classical world.

It is a moment that sees dramatic changes in who artists are, how they are trained, what kind of art they make, and the audiences to whom they appeal. This course surveys U.S. and European art history from 1945 to the present so that students gain a thorough understanding of the social, political, and economic forces that contributed to the development of significant art movements including abstract expressionism, pop art, and minimalism, as well as key modes of artmaking including painting and sculpture, happenings, installations, video, earthworks, and participatory art. The course also trains students in philosophies of art and tracks the dramatic changes in aesthetics over the period. Primarily a lecture course, students’ historical knowledge is assessed through two in-class examinations in which they identify, compare, contrast, and think critically about works of art. In addition, students practice discipline-specific research skills by compiling an annotated bibliography and writing short papers that rigorously examine primary sources.

These 'Successor Kingdoms,' most notably the Seleucids in the Near East and the Ptolemies in Egypt, engaged with the cultures of conquered people and produced new customs and royal identities. Explore the interchange of these forces through text, architecture, coins, and artwork during this pivotal time--from the campaigns of Alexander to the death of Cleopatra (336-30 BCE.)

While this survey concentrates on the main developments of Greek art, an important sub-theme of this course this is the changes Classical visual culture underwent as it served non-Greek peoples, including the role it played for Alexander and his successors in forging multiethnic, globally minded empires in Western, Central and South Asia. No background in the time period or discipline is expected and therefore this class will also serve as an introduction to interdisciplinary study of art history and the classical world. A number of art historical methodologies will be introduced in order to not only give students a useful background in art history but to give them the tools to think as art historians and incorporate related visual and textual evidence meaningfully into their writing.

Throughout, the class will center the history of present-day China, India, Southeast Asia, and Japan, emphasizing whenever possible the perspectives of those impacted by empire rather than those perpetuating it. As such, assigned readings focus on primary sources supplemented by relevant secondary research, with optional readings providing significant breadth and depth for interested students seeking to delve further into their own interests or find new avenues of scholarly inquiry. All told, the histories included here represent some of the most significant events in recent centuries, but ones that often go overlooked in an academic context, covered only as a footnote in the histories of the West.

What do these labels mean, why are they applied, and do they ever cease to be applicable? Can we distinguish religion from culture, and what are the implications when we try? Why is it frequently asked whether Saul Bellow was ""really"" a Jewish writer, but it is impossible to read Philip Roth as anything other than that? How does Grace Paley's ""Jewishness"" come through even when she is writing about non-Jewish characters? We will address these issues and others as we explore the literature growing out of the Jewish immigrant experience in America, as well as the literature by Jewish writers more firmly, though still sometimes anxiously, rooted in American soil. In this course we will engage in a highly contextualized and historicized study of Jewish American literature from the 19th century to today.  We will discover in these texts how inherited Jewish culture and literary imaginings, developed over centuries of interaction between Jewish communities and the ""outside world,"" get reexamined, questioned, rejected, reimagined, reintegrated, and transformed within the crucible of American experience. The discussions that ensue will also provide a framework for engaging with the creative energies and cultural productivity of more recent immigrant communities in the United States and beyond. Immigration and the experience of immigrant communities continues to be at the forefront of American consciousness, as immigrants work to create new meanings and new narratives for their lives, and as those who immigrated before them provide contested meanings for the impact of immigration on their own narratives. This course, though grounded in Jewish narratives, will therefore provide students with an expanded vocabulary and perspective for engaging in this central and very current debate within the American experience.

Through their effects as carriers of disease, insects have decided the outcomes of numerous battles and wars, often causing many more deaths than weapons did.  On the other hand, beneficial insects have made important contributions to the development of many industries, in particular related to textiles and agriculture, and they also serve as important sources of food in many cultures.  Because of their varied and important roles in human life and well-being, insects feature prominently in sacred texts and have thus influenced spiritual and religious thought through the ages.  And from Greek times until the present, insects have contributed greatly to the development of scientific thought.  Many of the great naturalists throughout history – from Aristotle to Darwin to EO Wilson – have had an inordinate fascination with insects.  In the second half of the 20th century and beyond, insects sparked the environmental movement, serve as models for innovating technologies such as robots, and continue to shape our lives in fascinating, challenging and novel ways.  In this class we will discuss the major ways in which the fates of humans and insects have been intertwined over the course of human history.  Throughout the class we focus on ways that historical inquiry can be used to elucidate entomological questions and, conversely, how entomological knowledge can be brought to bear to solve historical mysteries.","3","3","No","1","3","AFV - A-F or Audit","-","Every Spring"

We seem to mean that our core beliefs and assumptions are affected and the relationship with our environment is ruptured; we have fallen out of normalcy. The term existentialism -- turning existential into a noun -- came into being in the 1940s in France, reflecting the collective experience of societal breakdown, of Nazism, and WW2. It has since been applied to all modes of philosophical inquiry that take an individual's experience of alienation from society as their point of departure. The advantage of making alienation the focus of this class, too, is that it allows us to recognize the precise historical and sociological index of the emergence of an existentialist mode of thought and practice. Existentialism looks very different when it responds to a 19th century crisis of faith (Søren Kierkegaard), to 1950s colonialism (Frantz Fanon), to Weimar Germany's new democracy and the specter of a mass society (Martin Heidegger), or to the neo-authoritarian French society of the 1960s (Simone de Beauvoir). Existentialism then is understood in this class not as a conversation between great thinkers or ideas across time and space, but as a response to a specific crisis of norms and values. It only exists in plural. If existentialist concepts -- like being-in-the world, being-towards-death, or the gaze of the other -- are carried forward, then not without being repurposed. Such situatedness is inherent to existentialism itself. Accordingly, existentialist writers have no creed or ethical stance in common; they are found both on the far (fascist) right and on the Marxist left. They do share though a keen interest in a new language and in literary forms of expression and subsequently, they insist on the individuals' capacity of ""world-making"" -- in rupture and rebellion -- against seemingly compromised societal norms.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Spring Even Year"

This class will introduce students to the debates about the politics of memory and the artistic representation of the Holocaust, with special focus on public debates about the complex ways in which Holocaust memory surfaces in contemporary Germany and Austria, and by the accrual of layers of text and discourse about the Holocaust. We will explore the controversies and debates about public Holocaust memorialization in Germany, Austria, and the U.S. We will also explore the complex interplay between documentary and fictional accounts of the Holocaust, with attention paid to literary and film texts that challenge and ""remediate"" the limits of Holocaust representation. Additional topics will include Holocaust testimony; Holocaust memoirs, and 2nd and 3rd generation Holocaust literature, the Historians' Debate of the 1980s.

With over three millennia as its subject, the course must of necessity be a general survey.

The course begins by examining the roots of Judaism in the Hebrew Bible and the history of ancient Israel but quickly focuses on the creative forces that developed within Judaism as a national narrative confronted the forces of history, especially in the forms of the Persian, Greek, and Roman empires. Rabbinic Judaism becomes the most dominant creative force and will receive our greatest attention, both in its formative years and as it encounters the rise of Christianity and Islam. After studying the Jewish experience in the medieval world, we will turn to Judaism’s encounter with the enlightenment and modernity. The historical survey concludes by attending to the transformations within Judaism and Jewish life of the last 150 years, including a confrontation with the experience of the Holocaust. Woven throughout this historical survey will be repeated engagements with core questions: “Who is a Jew?” “What do Jews believe?” “What do Jews do?” “What do we mean by ‘religion’?”   “How do Jews read texts within their tradition?” And perhaps most importantly, “How many answers are there to a Jewish question?” Students in this course can expect to come away with some knowledge of the Bible in Judaism, rabbinic literature and law, Jewish mysticism and philosophy, Jewish nationalism and Zionism, Jewish culture, ritual, and worship in the synagogue, the home, and the community, and Jewish celebrations of life cycle events and the festivals.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Fall"

It was also marked by the rise of a series of New Right movements from the rise of the Barry Goldwater to the election of Richard Nixon and the transformation of both the Democratic and Republican parties. Major immigration reform, transformations in the nation's educational and health care systems, along side new patterns of consumption and new forms of media were also products of the Sixties.

"HIST","3054","Ancient Egypt and its Neighbors","Twin Cities","Ancient Egypt exerts fascination upon modern societies, as it did upon its ancient contemporaries. The decipherment of the hieroglyphic script, in the early 19th century CE, opened the way to recovering its history all the way back to the invention of the writing system more than 5,000 years ago. Ancient Egypt has meanwhile been a special focus of racialized interpretations of civilization, from the birth of modern Egyptology onward. Europeans of the colonial age saw Egyptian civilization as an anomaly in Africa, measured excavated skulls in an effort to prove its extraneous origins and segregated it from its geographic context. But Egyptian civilization did not develop in isolation. Rather it developed in concert with its neighbors upstream along the Nile, across adjacent deserts and seas, and over the land bridge to southwestern Asia. Its most important neighbor in northeastern Africa was the land of Kush (Nubia), where a series of cultures and states co-evolved with those of Egypt. Archaeological exploration continues to add to our knowledge of these interconnected pasts. This course will examine the history of Egypt, Kush, and adjacent regions from the late 4th millennium BCE, when the first states formed in the Nile Valley, to the late first millennium BCE, when Egypt fell under Roman rule while the kingdom of Meroe ruled the upper Nile. While the civilizations of northeastern Africa are the focus, the course will also examine their interactions with cultures of the Near East and Eastern Mediterranean. Since knowledge of ancient societies is derived from the texts and artifacts they produced, complete with their original context so far as possible, this course will emphasize primary sources, including texts (in translation), images, and archaeological remains.
There are no prerequisites for the course; the only preparation necessary consists in college-level writing skills, and readiness to learn new information. Be advised that the study of ancient history requires learning a great number of foreign names and terms, as well as a lot of dates. One cannot understand relations between events and phenomena, in particular relations of cause and effect, without knowing their chronology, the participants involved, and their locations. Students must therefore learn the geography of the regions under discussion, the dates of events and periods during the three millennia the course covers, the names of populations and individual persons, and terms pertaining to the subjects of study.

Wherever there was trade, wherever there was movement on the seas, there was piracy. Recent scholarship on the Mediterranean has focused on connectivities, micro-environments, the uniqueness of islands, and various climatic spheres in a geographic tradition that follows the path-breaking work of Fernand Braudel. This course will consider the urban and rural dimensions of the Mediterranean region as they relate to the history of merchants and pirates. Finally, the political and military aspects of Mediterranean history will be examined. There was a continuum from piracy to privateering to war. Students should gain a deeper understanding of a region that continues to fascinate us today.","3","3","No","1","3","OPN - Student Option No Audit","-","Spring Odd Year"

In South Africa, we have seen the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures implemented to control it causing massive social upheaval and personal distress. It has forced the people in the country to confront issues that life prior to the pandemic had made easy to turn away from. Misogyny, gender based violence and sexual violence – a long-standing emergency in the south of Africa – have been forced into our vision once again. It was not the pandemic that created this violence. Nor was it the first time people had been outraged by a lack of action to address it. In the years approaching 2020, calls, protests and demonstrations were increasingly demanding the culture of impunity in gender based violence be ended; sometime with violent outcomes against the protestors themselves. Over those same years, nationwide protests have rocked South Africa’s university campuses. The student movements known as #RhodesMustFall, #FeesMustFall and #RUReferenceList highlight the contrasts and disappointments of the recent past in South Africa, confront the legacy of racism and misogyny in its institutions and knowledge systems, and resonate with a history of anti-racism and struggle that now, in turn, similarly fuel the on-going Black Lives Matter and #MeToo movements worldwide.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Periodic Fall"

With over three millennia as its subject, the course must of necessity be a general survey. Together we will explore the mythic structures, significant documents, historical experiences, narratives, practices, beliefs, and worldviews of the Jewish people. The course begins by examining the roots of Judaism in the Hebrew Bible and the history of ancient Israel but quickly focuses on the creative forces that developed within Judaism as a national narrative confronted the forces of history, especially in the forms of the Persian, Greek, and Roman empires.  Rabbinic Judaism becomes the most dominant creative force and will receive our greatest attention, both in its formative years and as it encounters the rise of Christianity and Islam. After studying the Jewish experience in the medieval world, we will turn to Judaism’s encounter with the enlightenment and modernity. The historical survey concludes by attending to the transformations within Judaism and Jewish life of the last 150 years, including a confrontation with the experience of the Holocaust. Woven throughout this historical survey will be repeated engagements with core questions: “Who is a Jew?” “What do Jews believe?” “What do Jews do?” “What do we mean by ‘religion’?”   “How do Jews read texts within their tradition?” And perhaps most importantly, “How many answers are there to a Jewish question?” Students in this course can expect to come away with some knowledge of the Bible in Judaism, rabbinic literature and law, Jewish mysticism and philosophy, Jewish nationalism and Zionism, Jewish culture, ritual, and worship in the synagogue, the home, and the community, and Jewish celebrations of life cycle events and the festivals.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Fall"

"HIST","3749","Central and Eastern European Migrants in Minnesota","Twin Cities","In this class, we will use Minnesota, particularly the Twin Cities, as a lens through which to examine the history of Central and Eastern European migration to the United States (U.S.) from the late 19th century to the present. Moving chronologically and from the global to the local, this class will first examine the complex and intertwined reasons that prompted people to settle (either temporally or permanently) in the U.S. in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. We will explore the communalities and differences between the Poles, Ukrainians, Germans, Czechs, Slovaks, Jews, Hungarians, Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs who made up this initial wave of migration, and assess how these migrants shaped the urban and social fabric both in the United States, and in St. Paul and Minneapolis. Second, the class will examine how these communities evolved over the course in the 20th century by a) exploring topics such as ethnic identity maintenance, inter-generational relations, return migration, xenophobia and antisemitism, the relationship between migrants and the host society, and institutions (churches and synagogues, fraternal organizations, learned societies, archives, museums and libraries, etc.) established by migrants in the U.S., and b) assessing the impacts of later migration waves from Europe to the U.S., caused by the Holocaust and the Second World War, the 1956 Hungarian uprising, the 1968 Prague Spring, Soviet emigration policies, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the civil wars in Yugoslavia. 

Keeping in mind the pressing ethical questions that subtend migration (both historical and contemporary), this class will also ask what it means to be a descendant of Central and Eastern European migrants in present-day Minnesota—not just of those who arrived over a century ago, but also more recent migrants, e.g., Russians, or Muslims from Bosnia-Hercegovina. To this end, we will enrich our classroom by extending it into the metro area with visits to relevant sites and meetings with representatives of some of these communities in order to understand their current lives, work, and challenges. This class will thus draw on numerous local resources: archives, buildings such as religious sites and community centers, museums, etc.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Periodic Spring"

However, is that really the case? The 1970s have turned out to be an ever more important decade to examine, research, and think about. The previously declared “stagnant” decade has been the subject of newfound attention and together we will immerse ourselves in the music, politics, technology, and issues of the time to discover exactly how disco came to dominate the music charts, how people lost hope in the political system, how civil rights activists continued the quest for equality, and how folks did their best to stay alive in a very confusing decade.","3","3","No","1","3","A-F - A-F Grade Basis","-","Periodic Spring"

Students have also turned their attention inward to demand that the university change or expand in one way or another. In all of these ways, students are engaging in civic life and thinking through the ethics of many public problems.

Through a focus on the United States and particular attention paid to the University of Minnesota itself, students will think deeply about questions of activism and reflect on the actions of their direct historical counterparts.

It asks how technological differences between nations influenced their different courses of development, and why some societies seemed to advance while others did not. We ask how technological choices can bring about consequences greater than people expected, and how we might use this knowledge in making our own technological choices. In particular, we explore the historical background, development, and character of the most widespread technological systems the world has known, from prehistoric stone tool societies, through Egypt and the pyramids, ancient Greece and Rome, the explosion of Islam, and the dynamic and often violent technologies of medieval Europe.","3","4","No","1","4","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Fall & Spring"

This course will examine large scale natural events in American and world history, the social, technological, and environmental conditions that underlie them, and their historical consequences. Human societies have long been embedded in physical landscapes where they are subject to specific environmental conditions and physical risks: eight thousand-year-old wall paintings in Turkey depict the eruption of Hasan Dag volcano over the city of Catal Huyuk, for example. But then and now, it takes a certain combination of social conditions and environmental events to create a natural disaster. In this course, we will use historical natural disasters to explore the interconnections between the structures and ideas of human society and environmental forces. Humans have not been simply the random victims of natural disasters; where and how they chose to live influenced the impact of any disastrous event. Examining these events in a historical context will help us see the social, technological, scientific, and environmental systems that have been constantly interacting, but which are normally taken for granted until they break down.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Periodic Spring"

The environment of the frigid and heavily forested heartland of early Russian civilization, as well as that of the ""wild field"" (the Eurasian steppe) on its border, have posed a series of challenges to Russians and have left an indelible mark on modern Russian culture.  In this interdisciplinary seminar, we will study how Russians have conceived of and used nature from the medieval period to the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Articulating a particular approach to nature has been integral to several ideological and cultural projects in Russian history, including the formation of a literary tradition, the establishment of a multi-ethnic empire encompassing several biomes, and the development of a vision of Soviet science conquering and reshaping nature and the world. In the period we will study (the fifteenth century to 1991 Russia) underwent several profound epistemological shifts, and a particular focus of this course will be how the ways Russians created natural knowledge changed over time. Knowledge is power, and we will study how natural knowledge was used to strengthen and expand the state in the medieval, imperial, and Soviet periods. Another major focus of this course is the ravages that nature and humankind have inflicted on one another, and we will study how the environment influenced the development of Russia's form of agricultural slavery, serfdom, as well as the history of environmental degradation, including deforestation, the establishment of heavy industry, and nuclear disaster.","3","3","No","1","3","A-F - A-F Grade Basis","000571","Periodic Spring"

With over three millennia as its subject, the course must of necessity be a general survey. Together we will explore the mythic structures, significant documents, historical experiences, narratives, practices, beliefs, and worldviews of the Jewish people. The course begins by examining the roots of Judaism in the Hebrew Bible and the history of ancient Israel but quickly focuses on the creative forces that developed within Judaism as a national narrative confronted the forces of history, especially in the forms of the Persian, Greek, and Roman empires.  Rabbinic Judaism becomes the most dominant creative force and will receive our greatest attention, both in its formative years and as it encounters the rise of Christianity and Islam. After studying the Jewish experience in the medieval world, we will turn to Judaism’s encounter with the enlightenment and modernity. The historical survey concludes by attending to the transformations within Judaism and Jewish life of the last 150 years, including a confrontation with the experience of the Holocaust. Woven throughout this historical survey will be repeated engagements with core questions: “Who is a Jew?” “What do Jews believe?” “What do Jews do?” “What do we mean by ‘religion’?”   “How do Jews read texts within their tradition?” And perhaps most importantly, “How many answers are there to a Jewish question?” Students in this course can expect to come away with some knowledge of the Bible in Judaism, rabbinic literature and law, Jewish mysticism and philosophy, Jewish nationalism and Zionism, Jewish culture, ritual, and worship in the synagogue, the home, and the community, and Jewish celebrations of life cycle events and the festivals.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Fall"

What do these labels mean, why are they applied, and do they ever cease to be applicable? Can we distinguish religion from culture, and what are the implications when we try? Why is it frequently asked whether Saul Bellow was “really” a Jewish writer, but it is impossible to read Philip Roth as anything other than that? How does Grace Paley’s “Jewishness” come through even when she is writing about non-Jewish characters? We will address these issues and others as we explore the literature growing out of the Jewish immigrant experience in America, as well as the literature by Jewish writers more firmly, though still sometimes anxiously, rooted in American soil.

In this course we will engage in a highly contextualized and historicized study of Jewish American literature from the 19th century to today.  We will discover in these texts how inherited Jewish culture and literary imaginings, developed over centuries of interaction between Jewish communities and the “outside world,” get reexamined, questioned, rejected, reimagined, reintegrated, and transformed within the crucible of American experience. The discussions that ensue will also provide a framework for engaging with the creative energies and cultural productivity of more recent immigrant communities in the United States and beyond. Immigration and the experience of immigrant communities continues to be at the forefront of American consciousness, as immigrants work to create new meanings and new narratives for their lives, and as those who immigrated before them provide contested meanings for the impact of immigration on their own narratives. This course, though grounded in Jewish narratives, will therefore provide students with an expanded vocabulary and perspective for engaging in this central and very current debate within the American experience.

This course has several objectives: first, to deepen students' historical knowledge of the events and experiences of the Holocaust, and at the same time to introduce critical models for examining the relationship between personal experience, historical events, and forms of representation. This class will introduce students to the debates about the politics of memory and the artistic representation of the Holocaust, with special focus on public debates about the complex ways in which Holocaust memory surfaces in contemporary Germany and Austria, and by the accrual of layers of text and discourse about the Holocaust. We will explore the controversies and debates about public Holocaust memorialization in Germany, Austria, and the U.S. We will also explore the complex interplay between documentary and fictional accounts of the Holocaust, with attention paid to literary and film texts that challenge and ""remediate"" the limits of Holocaust representation.

"PHIL","3009","Existentialism","Twin Cities","What do we mean when we call something ""existential?""  What do we mean when we speak of an ""existential"" crisis? We seem to mean that our core beliefs and assumptions are affected and the relationship with our environment is ruptured; we have fallen out of normalcy. The term existentialism -- turning existential into a noun -- came into being in the 1940s in France, reflecting the collective experience of societal breakdown, of Nazism, and WW2. It has since been applied to all modes of philosophical inquiry that take an individual's experience of alienation from society as their point of departure. The advantage of making alienation the focus of this class, too, is that it allows us to recognize the precise historical and sociological index of the emergence of an existentialist mode of thought and practice. Existentialism looks very different when it responds to a 19th century crisis of faith (Søren Kierkegaard), to 1950s colonialism (Frantz Fanon), to Weimar Germany's new democracy and the specter of a mass society (Martin Heidegger), or to the neo-authoritarian French society of the 1960s (Simone de Beauvoir). Existentialism then is understood in this class not as a conversation between great thinkers or ideas across time and space, but as a response to a specific crisis of norms and values. It only exists in plural. If existentialist concepts -- like being-in-the world, being-towards-death, or the gaze of the other -- are carried forward, then not without being repurposed. Such situatedness is inherent to existentialism itself. Accordingly, existentialist writers have no creed or ethical stance in common; they are found both on the far (fascist) right and on the Marxist left. They do share though a keen interest in a new language and in literary forms of expression and subsequently, they insist on the individuals' capacity of ""world-making"" -- in rupture and rebellion -- against seemingly compromised societal norms.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Spring Even Year"

Political theory analyzes the meaning and significance of fundamental concepts in politics. Starting from such basic concerns as the nature of politics, humans, power, and justice, political theorists explore how these basic starting assumptions organize the norms, practices, and institutions of political and social order. To explore these topics, the field turns to key texts, as well as to political and social events and other media (film, historical documents, etc.). In this introductory course, students will investigate some of the basic texts in political theory, with the goal of learning how to read texts more analytically and to address fundamental questions in political theory. Among the topics that might be the nature of justice and injustice, political obligation and civil disobedience, democracy and other forms of governance. Students who complete this course will understand the deep issues about the nature of politics and will have learned to read and analyze complex texts.

"POL","3282","Black Political Thought: Conceptions of Freedom","Twin Cities","On January 21, 1964, Ella Baker, one of the most important Black leaders of the Civil Rights Movement stood in front of a large crowd in Hattiesburg, Mississippi and said: ""Even if segregation is gone, we will still need to be free; we will still have to see that everyone has a job. Even if we can all vote, but if people are still hungry, we will not be free. Remember, we are not fighting for the freedom of the Negro alone, but for the freedom of the human spirit, a larger freedom that encompasses all mankind.""

With these words, Baker held before the crowd a political vision that went beyond the immediate goals of social struggle and defined one of the central impulses of Black political thought: to articulate a large and expansive conception of freedom. In this course, our main objective is to enter an intellectual terrain of rich and vibrant debates between African American political thinkers over the meaning of Black freedom.

We will explore questions about 1) the geographical reach of their visions of freedom 2) their strategies for agitating for and achieving freedom 3) their different understandings of the nature of domination and how this informs their conception of freedom and 4) their emphasis on political affect in the struggle for freedom.

Our orientation will be historical and theoretical. To this end, we reconstruct theoretical debates from four important periods of African American history. 1) pre-Civil War debates about the abolition of slavery (1830-1860) 2) Turn of the century debates about racial progress (1880-1910) 3) Civil rights era debates about integration and separatism (1950-1970) and 4) contemporary debates about law enforcement, police killings, mass incarceration, and political disenfranchisement (1990-present).","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Periodic Fall & Spring"

Vladimir Lenin, too, had better democratic credentials than Max Weber and Woodrow Wilson.  That’s the provocative argument of this course.  Performing what it calls “comparative real-time political analysis,” it presents convincing evidence to sustain both claims.  When the two sets of protagonists are compared and contrasted in how they read and responded to big political events in motion, in real-time, the Marxists, it contends, proved to be better democrats than the Liberals.  Real-time analysis argues that responding to and making decisions about events in motion is the real test of political perspective and theory; on Monday morning, we can all look smart.  The writings and actions of all seven protagonists are the primary course materials—reading them in their own words.  The European Spring of 1848, the United States Civil War, the 1905 Russian Revolution and, the 1917 Russian Revolution and end of World War I, all consequential in the democratic quest, are the main scenarios the course employs to test its claims.

We will investigate this question through a study of such key thinkers as Kant, Mill, Marx, Lenin, Césaire, Fanon, and Gandhi, reading them through the lens of empire. Our goal is to analyze how such thinkers reflected upon, problematized and, at times, justified forms of Western imperialism. We will look at their explicit reflections on empire, as well as more tangential or ostensibly separate themes that may have only been shaped by the imperial context in indirect ways. Finally, we will reflect upon our contemporary location as readers and agents situated in the wake of these political and intellectual developments, analyzed through the question of what it means to engage in anti-colonial, decolonial, and/or postcolonial critique. This course will combine lectures by the professor with student-led seminar discussion.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Periodic Fall & Spring"
"RELS","1034","Introduction to Jewish History and Cultures","Twin Cities","This course traces the development of Judaism and Jewish civilizations from their beginnings to the present. With over three millennia as its subject, the course must of necessity be a general survey. Together we will explore the mythic structures, significant documents, historical experiences, narratives, practices, beliefs, and worldviews of the Jewish people. The course begins by examining the roots of Judaism in the Hebrew Bible and the history of ancient Israel but quickly focuses on the creative forces that developed within Judaism as a national narrative confronted the forces of history, especially in the forms of the Persian, Greek, and Roman empires.  Rabbinic Judaism becomes the most dominant creative force and will receive our greatest attention, both in its formative years and as it encounters the rise of Christianity and Islam. After studying the Jewish experience in the medieval world, we will turn to Judaism’s encounter with the enlightenment and modernity. The historical survey concludes by attending to the transformations within Judaism and Jewish life of the last 150 years, including a confrontation with the experience of the Holocaust. Woven throughout this historical survey will be repeated engagements with core questions: “Who is a Jew?” “What do Jews believe?” “What do Jews do?” “What do we mean by ‘religion’?”   “How do Jews read texts within their tradition?” And perhaps most importantly, “How many answers are there to a Jewish question?” Students in this course can expect to come away with some knowledge of the Bible in Judaism, rabbinic literature and law, Jewish mysticism and philosophy, Jewish nationalism and Zionism, Jewish culture, ritual, and worship in the synagogue, the home, and the community, and Jewish celebrations of life cycle events and the festivals.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Fall"

Douglas's ideas have been influential in ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern studies and provide a framework for us to analyze how people in antiquity conceptualized ideas of purity, pollution, ritual sacrifice, sacred spaces, bodily leakages, and the liminal stages of life and death. We'll delve into Douglas's theory in light of ancient examples with a special focus on ancient Israelite texts (the Tanakh or Old Testament) as well as ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern building inscriptions, specialist manuals, and rituals. Through this evidence, we'll gain profound insight into the ancient notions of ""sacred/clean"" (purity) and the ""unclean/profane"" (pollution).","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Spring"

"RELS","3628","Jewish American Literature: Religion, Culture, and the Immigrant Experience","Twin Cities","Immigrant? Jewish? American?  What do these labels mean, why are they applied, and do they ever cease to be applicable? Can we distinguish religion from culture, and what are the implications when we try? Why is it frequently asked whether Saul Bellow was “really” a Jewish writer, but it is impossible to read Philip Roth as anything other than that? How does Grace Paley’s “Jewishness” come through even when she is writing about non-Jewish characters? We will address these issues and others as we explore the literature growing out of the Jewish immigrant experience in America, as well as the literature by Jewish writers more firmly, though still sometimes anxiously, rooted in American soil.In this course we will engage in a highly contextualized and historicized study of Jewish American literature from the 19th century to today.  We will discover in these texts how inherited Jewish culture and literary imaginings, developed over centuries of interaction between Jewish communities and the “outside world,” get reexamined, questioned, rejected, reimagined, reintegrated, and transformed within the crucible of American experience. The discussions that ensue will also provide a framework for engaging with the creative energies and cultural productivity of more recent immigrant communities in the United States and beyond. Immigration and the experience of immigrant communities continues to be at the forefront of American consciousness, as immigrants work to create new meanings and new narratives for their lives, and as those who immigrated before them provide contested meanings for the impact of immigration on their own narratives. This course, though grounded in Jewish narratives, will therefore provide students with an expanded vocabulary and perspective for engaging in this central and very current debate within the American experience.

We will discuss how theatre makers and thinkers responded to this call by offering playtexts and performance practices which challenged mainstream theatre in the era of the revolutions in time and space—Naturalism, Symbolism, Futurism, Dada, Surrealism; Agit-Prop, Theatre of the Oppressed, Theatre for Social Change; Black, Feminist, Queer Theatres; and Pixelated Revolutions. We will investigate histories, politics, and aesthetics of theatre and performance in a variety of cultural and ideological contexts. While reviewing these representational practices, which materialize as play-texts, performances, theatre architecture, theatre rebellions and regulations, theoretical writings, etc., we will discuss how they were produced, given intelligibility, and disseminated.  One may ask: what are the consequences of using or promoting these and not other representational practices? How are performance events brought to our attention by the past and present imaginations? How are they made worthy of notice are rationalized as significant for theatre history.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","012084","Every Spring"
"YOST","3001","Introduction to History & Philosophy of Youthwork","Twin Cities","This course exposes students to a depth of perspectives on young people and youth work. Exploring various historic and philosophical origins of “normal” childhood, we unveil the way our modern understandings of child, youth, and adolescent draw upon a rich history of sexist, colonialist, and racist science. To do so we explore Indigenous, early European, Middle-Class, and W.E.I.R.D. (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic) notions of childhood. We explore how these ideas are operationalized into practices on youth/youth work. We explore how contemporary organizations of American youth work and youth development, then took up and applied these ideas thus naturalizing modern norms and expectations of child and youth. This course covers the philosophical and historical foundations of youth work in a critical and interactive way through a review of youth, youth work, and youth organizations set in the context of the past 500 years. 

The course is designed to encourage students to examine their familial histories, timelines, and geographies and through collaborative and interactive learning, begin to explore how these histories, combined with others, helped to shape the ways that we think about youth and how this thinking collectively shapes youth policy, practice, and the institutions within which we meet and work with young people. All of this with the goal of becoming more effective and thoughtful when working with young people in youth-work settings. Whether you choose to work in youth-work settings or in other human service organization or agency, developing a sense of cultural humility and skills to understand historical data, philosophical frames, and current practices will be critical to your success in professional arenas.
