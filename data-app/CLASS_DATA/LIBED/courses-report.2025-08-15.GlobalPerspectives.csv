"AFRO","1009","History of Women in Africa: 1500 to the Present","Twin Cities","This course examines the histories of women on African frontiers. The course will highlight the role of women in their relation with family, with other African/nonAfrican peoples, as well as the role of women of the border regions of Sahel-Savanna, SavannaForest, within the country of Morocco, and along the Indian Ocean-Swahili Coast and Atlantic Coast frontiers. AFRO 1009 will compare the roles of African women from specific regions to others in different times and places in Africa, as well as with their contemporaries in Asia, Europe, and the Americas. We will consider the ways in which the women under scrutiny played a critical role in the dynamic changes that transformed their worlds and the worlds around
them. Indeed, the historical lens that informs and underpins this course is premised on the understanding that people make change and that change does not just happen in and of itself. In recognizing the process of change over time, AFRO 1009 emphasizes the significance of social
and cultural context in shaping the extent and nature of women’s participation in these processes. Therefore, the course will seek to understand the cultural beliefs and the rich ethnic, economic, religious networks, which buttressed the women’s roles and examine their associated factors. In
addition to stressing the importance of change over time, AFRO 1009 engages students in a reflection of the past in an attempt to understand those reflections within the continuum of past, present, and future. Accordingly, AFRO 1009 impels us to think about the long term effects of
any change, however slight or insignificant it may seem.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Fall"
"AFRO","1021","Introduction to Africa","Twin Cities","Through a close engagement with selected oral, visual, audio-visual, and written sources, this course interrogates the representation of Africa as a failed and passive site, hopelessly mired in poverty and ill-equipped to face the challenges of the 21st century. Using the lens of gender as a critical category, the course specifically considers the ways in which African women have distinguished themselves in the areas of politics, the economy, culture, education, and other fields. The historical lens that informs and underpins this course is premised on the understanding that people make change, and that change does not just happen in and of itself. In recognizing the process of change over time, AFRO 1021 demonstrates that African women have played a pivotal role in the dynamic changes that have transformed the continent and its diverse societies. More importantly, African women have always defined and carried out their own struggles, always been on the frontline of agitating for socio-economic and political reforms, and always played critical leadership roles in their families, communities, and civil society. In addition to stressing the importance of change over time, AFRO 1021 engages students in a reflection of the past to understand those reflections within the continuum of past, present, and future.","3","3","No","1","3","AFV - A-F or Audit","-","Every Fall & Spring"

Specifically, China's renewed interest in Africa continues to beg the question, what is China's Africa strategy or Africa-China strategy? Some scholars have suggested that China's strategic interests in Africa are purely economic, more specifically, resource extraction and exploitation, which has led to renewed concerns of neo-colonialism! Other questions that have been raised include how this engagement will benefit the African countries engaged with China.

In South Africa, we have seen the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures implemented to control it causing massive social upheaval and personal distress. It has forced the people in the country to confront issues that life prior to the pandemic had made easy to turn away from. Misogyny, gender based violence, and sexual violence, a long-standing emergency in the south of Africa, have been forced into our vision once again. It was not the pandemic that created this violence. Nor was it the first time people had been outraged by a lack of action to address it. In the years approaching 2020, calls, protests and demonstrations were increasingly demanding the culture of impunity in gender based violence be ended; sometime with violent outcomes against the protestors themselves. Over those same years, nationwide protests have rocked South Africa's university campuses. The student movements known as #RhodesMustFall, #FeesMustFall and #RUReferenceList highlight the contrasts and disappointments of the recent past in South Africa, confront the legacy of racism and misogyny in its institutions and knowledge systems, and resonate with a history of anti-racism and struggle that now, in turn, similarly fuel the on-going Black Lives Matter and #MeToo movements worldwide.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Periodic Fall"

These are the core questions that will guide our exploration of the political dynamics in the Horn of Africa. Just like most regions in Africa, the Horn is home to diverse cultures and languages. What distinguishes it, however, is the contested nature of state borders, which have been redrawn in ways not observed anywhere else in Africa since the end of European colonialism. The purpose of this class is to delve deeper into these conflicts, to examine the interactions between incumbent governments, armed rebel groups and international actors in shaping war and peace in the Horn. Throughout this journey, we will pay special attention to ideas of sovereignty, identity and violence and draw on literature outside of the Horn to help us better dissect what is going on within it.

Through an exploration of the stylistic and thematic issues raised by each film, it is expected that students will gain a broad understanding of how African filmmakers portray African social and cultural life, including the artistic and political contexts within which they work. In this way, students will gain an historical perspective on the origins of African filmmaking, confront the basic social, cultural, and aesthetic questions raised by African filmmakers and critics, and consider how questions raised by African filmmakers and their films fit into the larger context of world cinema. We will contrast postcolonial African films with Hollywood jungle epics, settler/adventure romances in safari paradise, and colonial movies about Africa. Moving beyond strict categories and standards we will also examine the role of documentary films in shaping our understanding of African people's lives and the social construction of reality.

A closer investigation will show that Black people have been traveling to Europe (willingly and unwillingly) for centuries. While Afro-Europeans remain at the margins of these nations, they find avenues to survive and thrive in the face of microaggressions and racism. As the semester progresses, we will examine the following questions: What is daily life like in a majority white country? In what ways are these authors included or excluded from national discourses? What ways do they bring attention to anti-Blackness in their local contexts? How do they define home and belonging?

As the global world developed the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) framework, we have seen an increase in innovative strategies by countries to meet the 2030 goals, with France emerging as a leader in their efforts. The 2030 Sustainable Development Goals are framed by five categories: planet, people, prosperity, peace, and partnership.  France has made some innovative efforts to move the needle in each of these categories. For example, France is leading the way with food security, having introduced a new international strategy for food security, nutrition, and sustainable agriculture in October 2019.  From public health and healthcare systems to food safety and security, the extensive challenges require collaboration, coordination, and an interprofessional approach to be successful.

According to writer Kim Ann Zimmerman, “The culture and underlying values in France are distinctly different from the US. The French believe in égalité, which means equality, and is part of the country's motto: ""Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité."" Many say they place a higher importance on equality than liberty and fraternity, the other two words in the motto.”  We will explore how France’s history, culture, and underlying values affect health, health disparities and systems that influence health, healthcare and SDGs","3","3","No","1","3","A-F - A-F Grade Basis","-","Every Spring"

These themes will be debated in a range of spaces and contexts: the desert, the city, and the ocean as quintessential environments in times of great social and ecological upheavals; migration flows and refugee identities; the alternating banality and grotesqueness of war; and the formation of intimate, personal relationships.

"AMES","3461","Martial Arts in Japan: Praxes, Philosophy, and Images in History","Twin Cities","	This course studies ""Martial arts in Japan"" by situating them in three phases of importance: 
(1) In medieval times (the 13-16th centuries), samurai—nominalized out of a verb, saburou (""to serve"")—came to overpower aristocrats, to whom they had literally been servers and servants in the previous classical era. With their martial skills, samurai became the major player of this era of multigenerational domestic belligerency. Ironically, martial arts had not yet existed during this ""age of samurai."" 
(2) Martial arts were born out of such medieval martial skills and theorized accordingly in the ensuing Edo era (1600-1867), when a major samurai household unified the country and materialized a long-lasting peacetime in which the ""real"" martial skills became increasingly irrelevant and devalued socially. 
(3) Then ""samurai"" also became irrelevant in modern times: the Meiji era (1868-1912) onward. For the last samurai government—the Edo shogunate—was unable to deal with then looming Western colonial powers and thus replaced by the first modern government, which chose rapid and intense westernization and modernization as their national policy to navigate amid the world-wide colonial milieu. Intriguingly, there emerged a certain discourse to identify the Japanese with ""samurai,"" despite the fact that ""samurai"" had only been a miniscule part of the population before, and while not being recognized overtly, ""martial arts"" seem to be a taken-for-granted, indispensable component of samurai images thus generated. Such images have continuously been amplified to date, with inevitable constant modifications, involving multiple media, not only texts in languages but also film, anime, manga, video game, etc.
	By historicizing ""martial arts"" in this manner, the course aims not only at (A) understanding them as effectively as possible, including such philosophical questions as ""body,"" ""body grammar,"" ""body-mind relationship,"" and, most fundamentally, ""performative nature of a being,"" but also at (B) experiencing firsthand the highly complicated and elusive relationship between what are called primary and secondary sources as well as the necessity to distinguish them nevertheless.
	This course is open to anyone with an interest. No prerequisite. No previous knowledge nor learning experience of martial arts and of Japanese is required.

The course is guided by three different problematics: the arrival of cinema as an imported technology that coincided with and was arguably contingent upon the European colonial presence in the region; the ideological conflicts of the Cold War, anti-Communist sentiments; and the emergence of national film industries vis-à-vis independent cinema in the contemporary time.

Following a survey of classic texts and contexts, we will ask why modern authors summon demons and resurrect ghosts, and what political and cultural work these unruly beings are called to perform.

Internationally renowned for its artistic, thematic, and narrative prowess, post-revolutionary Iranian cinema is unique in its ability to capture the aspirations, struggles, and triumphs of ordinary Iranians as they manage life in the Islamic Republic. In moving beyond stereotypical images presented by mass media, modern Iranian cinema provides a medium for us to delve into the complex makeup of issues such as religion, gender, class, and politics in Iran today. How does Iranian cinema reflect Iran's culture, society and politics? What role does Iranian cinema play in shaping Iran's national identity? What new insights does Iranian cinema shed onto the interests, subjectivities, and desires of Iranians themselves? Throughout this course, we will attempt to answer these questions by viewing a number of masterpieces of Iranian cinema and reading related social, historical, and political analyses. By engaging in an exploration of daily life in Iran through film, we will gain a more nuanced understanding of Iran's modern landscape and the diversity of opinions and experiences that it constitutes. This course will also serve as an introduction to Iranian history, especially following the 1979 revolution.

"ANTH","2006","Humans and Aliens: Learning Anthropology through Science Fiction","Twin Cities","Science Fiction has been one of the most popular genres of literature over the last century and a half. Despite its great popularity, however, many fans of the genre do not realize how much it has in common with the discipline of Anthropology. Anthropology is the study of what it means to be human in all times and places. Science fiction, for its part, explores human existence in equally diverse contexts, except that those imagined contexts frequently have not yet happened. Despite this similarity, anthropology is extremely poorly known compared to science fiction. This course uses the stimulating and entertaining literature of science fiction to expose students to anthropology who, having never been exposed to it in high school, are likely to leave university without learning the power of the discipline’s perspective on humanity. Through individual pairings of anthropology texts and science fiction stories, the course explores the relevance of biological anthropology, social anthropology, linguistic anthropology, and archaeology to humanity’s future. The course’s juxtaposition of anthropological literature to science fiction stories is designed to provide students with the ability to see how our future is more dependent on how humanity works (as anthropology understands it), than merely what the next technological invention has to offer us.  
	This course introduces students to the breadth of anthropological topics using the literature of such award-winning science fiction (SF) authors as Isaac Asimov, Elisabeth Bear, Jerome Bixby, Octavia Butler, Ted Chiang, Arthur C. Clarke, Philip K. Dick, Robert Heinlein, Frank Herbert, Ursula K. Le Guin, Catherine Moore, Mike Resnik, Kim Stanley Robinson, Neil Stephenson, James Tiptree, Jr., and Kurt Vonnegut. While the course is not designed to cover the literary criticism of SF literature nor the social analysis of the SF community of readers and authors, the choice of which SF authors to oppose to select anthropological topics was shaped by my understanding of the historical development of SF literature. Students will thus read stories written from the Golden Age of magazine SF to the most recent post-cyberpunk novelists. The selection of SF stories is of course idiosyncratic but it is designed to reflect the goal of learning something of anthropology while having a blast reading SF.

Of all sectors of the global economy, the agricultural and food sector is perhaps the most at risk. Producers within this industry are faced with the complicated equation being one of the principle causes of the problems listed above, while also retaining the responsibility to provide food for an ever-growing consumer base. Eating and good nutrition are vital human needs and food is a human right deeply rooted in culture and emotion. Food is a source of pleasure, a means of social integration, a reflection of cultural values, and of cultural identity. As a result, agrobusiness and food industry stakeholders are expected to meet the higher demand for food while also reassessing value chains, far beyond the classic economic and marketing approach, by introducing ecological, social, and cultural indicators when assessing operational standard and economic growth. 
is context, the idea of a terroir-driven food system represents strong sustainable alternative to standard commercial agricultural practices.

Conservation biology addresses the tradeoffs inherent in balancing human needs for extractable ecosystem goods and services with our need for biodiversity and natural conditions. Our discussions always include the biophysical science of ecosystems and the human resource science of decisions. This class engages you directly in understanding and communicating about sustainable resource management in Patagonia, the fabulously beautiful, highly diverse, end-of-the-word in South America. You will explore mountainous and marine landscapes, places where you will (at least hope to see) Elephant seals, Mountain Lions, Emperor Penguins, Guanacos, and Patagonian Foxes. You also will encounter invasive rabbits and beavers, gigantic salmon aquaculture opens and an open pit mine. You will work with local community members to develop a permanent mural depicting all that. And you wll work with peers to develop a video documenting your experience.

Humans have inhabited Patagonia for at last 14,000 years. For thousands of years, the nomadic Aónikenk people were the principal humans in the landscape. The technologically superior Mapuche people were predominant during the 1500s; Europeans (primarily Spanish and English) colonized the area from the mid-1500s; Chile has been an independent country since 1826. The economy of the area has been dominated by mining and agriculture. Mining extracts minerals and low quality coal. Agriculture includes sheep ranching as well as large scale marine salmon aquaculture. Sheep ranching resulted in thousands of miles of barbed wire fence, and millions of hectares of degraded grasslands, with associated negative impacts on wildlife. Wool prices were strong from the late 1800s through the mid 1950s, then dropped precipitously. As a result, many sheep estnacias were abandoned or turned into tourist lodges. Patagonia today is a land of expansive landscapes of mountains, grasslands, glaciers and high altitude lakes. The wildlife characteristic of the area include all Guanacos (a South American camel), the Huemel deer, Patagonian fox, hog nosed skunk and Andean Condor. Native marine life include penguins, elephant seals, leopard seals, and the Patagonian skate.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Spring"

This course will first meet on-campus, before our departure for a two-week experience in May.  

In English usage, Scandinavia can refer to Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, and sometimes used more broadly to include the Aland Islands, the Faroe Islands, Finland, and Iceland.  The use of the term Nordic can also include the aforementioned countries along with Finland and Greenland.

Throughout this course, we will embark on an experience through hands-on learning in Denmark and Sweden. Students will learn about, and reflect on, available food resources in Scandinavia, including how Scandinavian cuisine is intertwined with Scandinavian culture.

CFANS has partnered with DIS for this course.  DIS is a non-profit study abroad foundation established in Denmark in 1959, with locations in Copenhagen and Stockholm. DIS provides semester, academic year, and summer programs taught in English, and offers high-impact learning experiences for upper-division undergraduate students from distinguished North American colleges and universities. The intellectually challenging curriculum is broad, cutting edge, and enriched by experiential learning components, including faculty-led study tours across Europe. It provides students with opportunities for meaningful cultural engagement and personal growth, which is further enriched through housing and extracurricular offerings.

Activities and learning will take place at numerous locations throughout Scandinavia. Students will attend lectures and presentations taught by faculty who are experts in the field, and will have the opportunity to learn about the culture and cuisine in Scandinavia. In their exploration of Scandinavia, students will be exposed to a breadth of diverse cultural experiences in which they will be challenged to reflect on their emotional responses and active participation within Scandinavian culture and integrate these into their personal and professional worldview. Students will also visit important archaeological, sacred, and natural sites throughout Scandinavia to better understand the history of the region and the culture of its people.

Students will be encouraged early on to identify a particular interest they want to learn more about in Scandinavia (e.g. precision agriculture, dairy production, sustainability, agro-tourism, etc.) and find opportunities to integrate this interest into the questions they ask in their blog posts, their final project, and at site visits.","3","3","No","1","3","A-F - A-F Grade Basis","-","Periodic Spring"

England and Scotland have long been associated with unique culinary traditions. In England, dishes such

local areas, and what is a traditional dish in Scotland if not “haggis”? However, a survey from Mortar
Research (commissioned by Aldi) in 2000 found that many in the United Kingdom have not only never
tried some of these dishes, some have not even heard of them. Although some of the aforementioned
recipes have been available for hundreds of years, a shifting demographic of UK residents, access to new
food, and a decline in regional eating in the past 30 - 50 years has resulted in a paradigm shift as to what
is considered British and Scottish cuisine.","3","3","No","1","3","A-F - A-F Grade Basis","-","Periodic Spring"

"CFAN","3534","Climate Resilience in Agriculture: Exploring Diverse Regions and Empowering Youth in Morocco","Twin Cities","This course explores agricultural systems in geographically diverse regions of Morocco, the impacts of water scarcity on food production and society and approaches to mitigating and adapting to climate change. Morocco lies in the northwest corner of the African continent. It occupies a land area roughly equal to that of the state of Texas. Despite its relatively small size, Morocco stands out for its notable role in the fight against climate change. Due to declining rainfall and an increase in the severity and frequency of drought in recent decades, the Moroccan government has taken a comprehensive approach to reducing negative impacts on its citizens and promoting climate resilience. Agriculture, which comprises nearly 15% of the GDP of the country and employs nearly 40% of the population, is an important target for these efforts. Food security and economic stability are tightly linked to water availability. We will explore how agricultural systems in different regions are adapting to increasing water scarcity using diverse approaches including modification of production practices and technology. 

We will also consider the critical involvement of youth in agriculture. Despite improvements in agricultural productivity in recent years, the future of Moroccan agriculture is uncertain. While climate change is a clear threat, diminishing interest in agriculture among Moroccan youth is a growing concern. Youth ages 15-26 years old comprise about 26% of the country's population. Migration of youth from rural areas, especially in the mountain and dry-land regions, has accelerated in recent years largely due to increasing water scarcity and economic hardship. This represents the loss of human capacity in rural areas, increasing stress on resources in urban areas and the potential for growing social unrest. We will speak with community groups, organizations that work with young Moroccans and with young people themselves to understand the challenges they face and to learn about education and training efforts to promote youth participation in the agricultural economy. 

In addition to learning about the unique agricultural systems of Morocco, students in this course will gain appreciation for the history, culture, and traditions of the country. For more than five thousand years, Morocco has been the stage for cultural and economic exchange between Northern and sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Western Europe. Its modern culture is a beautiful and fascinating blend of Berber, Arab, Jewish, and Western European influences. 

This program involves pre-departure, in-country, and post-return activities and assignments. Pre-departure work will acquaint you with the country and culture of Morocco and introduce concepts that we will use throughout the program. In Morocco, you will experience the people, culture, and agriculture first hand. You will attend lectures, visit farms, converse with producers, meet with leaders of agricultural cooperatives and business owners and interact with Moroccan youth and leaders of organizations who work with youth. You will work independently and with a group to collect and interpret information and prepare presentations. We will visit historical and cultural sites of interest, interact with the people, and enjoy Moroccan cuisine. These experiences will provide rich opportunities for reflection and journal writing. Upon return to the U.S., you will finish the final reflection and complete the course survey.  ","3","3","No","1","3","A-F - A-F Grade Basis","-","Every Summer"

Priority for enrollment is given to University of Minnesota students, but students from other institutions may attend if space is available. There are no course prerequisites and all instruction is in English. New Zealand is a modern country with friendly people and awesome scenery.

Our daily news is filled with reports on climate change, water scarcity and pollution, soaring energy costs, and food shortages.   Solutions must consider environmental, economic, and social implications of our management strategies. Frequently there are tradeoffs between benefits and costs. University students as future leaders of business, government, and social programs should understand how to analyze environmental issues. What are the issues? Who is affected? What alternatives exist to solve them? What are the environmental, economic, and social tradeoffs between these alternatives? What are reliable sources of information? How can each of us contribute to solutions?

New Zealand has undergone significant changes in its plant and animal composition following the invasion of humans and the exotic species they introduced. Alarmed by these changes, New Zealanders recently have made significant strides in recognizing environmental issues and seeking sustainable solutions.

"DES","3151","Italian Design Studio: Blending Tradition and Innovation","Twin Cities","DES 3151 Italian Design Studio: Blending Tradition and Innovation exposes students to the productive intersection of ideas using the city of Rome and its makers as inspiration and context for interdisciplinary design work. The study abroad studio course is submitted to the Council on Liberal Education for approval for a Global Perspectives Theme.

Italian Design Studio meets general Core course requirements in the following ways:

ENHANCING A LIBERAL EDUCATION

Students in this course exercise design as a mode of thinking and practice in an interdisciplinary context. Design thinking is, at its essence, critical thinking for the material world. Design is a process of analyzing, interpreting and evaluating information from multiple viewpoints, and iteratively developing a response that synthesizes this information into a cohesive solution. Design projects never have a ""right answer."" Instead, students come to learn that ""good design"" emerges from a rigorous, creative and critical process of seeing design problems as design opportunities.

In this way, design studio and design thinking have an intriguing synergy with the values of a liberal education. 

A liberal education prepares students to engage a complex, diverse and changing world by seeing problems from multiple viewpoints. Design problems are complex by nature and require expansive thinking. Students who think like designers actively seek a variety of perspectives and intentionally zoom in and out to see a problem at a range of scales and in a shifting context. Students who think like designers are naturally curious about almost everything, and see inspiration and opportunity everywhere. Immersion in another culture naturally piques curiosity and presents an immediate challenge to practice seeing (things and processes big and small) from other perspectives.  

A liberal education prepares students to critically evaluate information and integrate knowledge. From a liberal investigation, students who think like designers begin to discern what is important, relevant and interesting from what is less important, less relevant and less interesting. Designers understand where conditions are fixed and where they have agency to make design decisions. Because the design process is both generative and iterative, integrating new knowledge and reevaluating what is valuable in the investigation is ongoing. While the design process is not a linear one, students in this course do learn that it is nonetheless rigorous, involving the art of opening up a problem, synthesizing a multitude of forces, and working within constraints.

A liberal education prepares students to engage the world as informed, ethical citizens. Design and making are deeply human endeavors that addresses who we are as physical, psychological, social, political and spiritual beings in relationship with the constant, changing and limited resources of our planet. Students in this course learn how the particular circumstances of time and place can have dramatic implications for our designed environment, from the scale of objects to the scale of cities.

A liberal education prepares students to value diverse ways of knowing and modes of inquiry. Designing the material world?whether apparel, graphic, landscape architecture, architecture or interior design?invites a fusion of art and science.  As a mode of inquiry, students in this course pursue design thinking as a rigorous and analytical process with a role for intuition and creativity. Designed objects and places express cultural aspirations and makes our experiences with the physical world poetic. In this way, de is allied with other arts and humanities disciplines. Yet, all designed things are beholden to a host of constraints or forces that lie beyond the control of the designer. Architecture, for example, must accommodate human behavior and needs, must shelter in a particular climate, and must respond to the laws of materials and gravit","3","3","No","1","3","A-F - A-F Grade Basis","-","Every Summer"

Throughout, the class will center the history of present-day China, India, Southeast Asia, and Japan, emphasizing whenever possible the perspectives of those impacted by empire rather than those perpetuating it. As such, assigned readings focus on primary sources supplemented by relevant secondary research, with optional readings providing significant breadth and depth for interested students seeking to delve further into their own interests or find new avenues of scholarly inquiry. All told, the histories included here represent some of the most significant events in recent centuries, but ones that often go overlooked in an academic context, covered only as a footnote in the histories of the West. Instead, this course will center the history of Asia and the voices of those impacted by imperialism, offering new perspectives on some of the most significant moments that shaped-and continue to shape-our contemporary world. 

Designed as an introductory course for those unfamiliar with the history of Asia, this class approaches a broad geographic and temporal range through case studies, diving deeply into crucial historical moments rather than providing an exhaustive overview of more than two centuries of Western imperialism. Simultaneously, this class will introduce students to the process of historical analysis itself using a substantial focus on primary sources, instructional time spent in libraries and archives, and a well-supported, intensive research essay process as a way to encourage them to think critically about the historical project while also honing their own historiographical skills. Overall, students will leave this course with a strong foundation in the history of Asia and the history of Western imperialism along with real practice doing history, preparing them for their future within the Department of History, at the University of Minnesota, and beyond.

We explore the role of financial services, merchandise trade, trade policy, immigrant populations and cultures, and other events in the evolution of modern London. Globalization, the interactions and interdependencies between the city of London and the rest of the world are researched and explored through course work and numerous site visits.

This course will involve the study of the history of international trade and the effects of Brexit on London and will take place in London. In addition, because of its history as a center for trade and development over the last several hundred years, and because of the current Brexit negotiations between UK and EU countries, London is an ideal location for experiential learning for global perspectives in this seminar. 

The city is also at the leading edge of environmental stewardship and has a net zero carbon target by 2030. In order to achieve deep decarbonization, the city has implemented a multipronged approach that includes behavioral incentives for residents and industries, improved efficiency standards, alternative fuels, wide-scale electrification, and embracing the clean energy transition. We will explore these drivers to understand the transformation London is going through to get to a net zero future.

Class discussions and assignments will include the role of ethics and equity in trade policies. Are trade policy changes intended to increase overall country welfare or do they increase welfare of certain groups over others? Through comparative welfare analysis, students are expected to come up with recommendations to improve the well-being of all individuals in the country.

We will discuss the race relations in London, the history of different peoples as they moved into London—the people from the Caribbean, from India in the 1950s and 1960s, Indians from African countries like Nigeria during Idi Amin’s rule, Bangladesh, the Jewish people after World War II.

"FOST","3896","Virtual International Internship","Twin Cities","This course is designed to provide students with an opportunity to learn about the virtual international work environment by critically examining a professional, remote experience abroad through an intercultural lens. A key element to this course is to deepen students’ knowledge of their internship placement country’s professional norms and cultural context in comparison to other students’ internship placement countries, as well as the United States, and understand how COVID-19 has impacted these environments. Students’ research and writing on COVID-19 globally will include ethical analysis on how the national approach has impacted society, if they agree with this approach or not, and why. We will interrogate how this knowledge will influence their behavior in their society and the world. Students will also enhance their understanding of their chosen field using a global mindset.

The course is designed to guide students in the internship experience and create a foundation for a successful professional career as well as working to understand and articulate career skill outcomes. In addition to gaining a cross-cultural comparative view on work, the topics and assignments will deepen students’ insights about themselves, professional expectations, and being successful in the virtual workplace. Students are expected to make a valuable contribution to the virtual internship placement through the completion of projects and tasks guided by their internship supervisor in the placement country. This will require students to employ intercultural communication skills in a professional, virtual setting while critically examining their own worldview.

Three Credit Course
Students who take the Virtual International Internship a second time will complete the three-credit version of this course and will be expected to complete the same number of hours at their internship sites as those who are taking the four-credit course. The academic work for the three-credit course will correspond to the second semester of internship participation in order to increase students’ remote, professional experience, strengthen their knowledge of their chosen industry, as well as enhance their global mind-set.

In this course, we will study troubadour songs, short tales, romances, and letters composed in twelfth-century France and Anglo-Norman England. We will examine their historical context: the patronage of Eleanor of Aquitaine and her family, the broader context of medieval court life, and the erudite circles that formed during the rise of the Parisian schools. Because what people say is determined by the language, motifs, and forms that they have available to them, we will discuss the transmission of ideas about love and the interpretation of exemplary figures (Tristan and Iseut, Lancelot and Guinevere). We will also consider the literary form of these texts in relation to their meaning. But at the heart of our inquiry will be the notion of the self. How did ""speaking of love"" allow medieval writers to cultivate their own subjectivity or individuality?

Texts will include troubadour songs, the Lais of Marie de France, the romances of Tristan and Iseut by Thomas of England and Béroul, Chrétien de Troyes's Arthurian romances, and the letters of Abelard and Heloise. We will also study a film about Eleanor of Aquitaine and her family (The Lion in Winter, 1968) and a contemporary opera about a troubadour and his lady, Kaija Saariaho's L'Amour de loin (2000).

It explores historical developments, cultures, and current issues facing the above populations through a set of contemporary films that stand out both for their exceptional aesthetic quality as well as their remarkable ability to confront pressing political and social issues. We will first discuss the ways in which visual media from the west have contributed to creating and perpetuating dominant tropes concerning black peoples, looking especially at the contribution of colonial imagery to the creation of such perceptions. We will subsequently examine the emergence of film-making in Africa before focusing on films by black directors from West and Central Africa, France, and the French Caribbean.

All of the films tackle migration and most of them deal with the crossing of the Mediterranean  Sea in particular. It focuses on how migrants, regular and clandestine migrations, as well as related themes, including globalization, hospitality and transnational modes of transportation have been filmed, discussed and written about in various types of discourses. 

Why and how do people emigrate? Where are the major destinations of migrants? What is Fortress Europe? What is the “global South?” What is the so-called refugee crisis? Who is a refugee? What impact has the Arab Spring had on contemporary migrations to Europe? How does mass media portray the global South? What do political discourses tell us about the European and North African handlings of recent human migratory movements? Can artists effectively put forward an alternate take on such issues? What types of responses in artistic productions as well as in the political and humanitarian arenas have failed attempts at crossing the Mediterranean Sea triggered? These are some of the questions we will address. Among the films that we will analyze—all shown in class—are Chus Gutiérrez’s Return to Hansala, Reem Kherici’s Paris or Perish, Ismaël Ferroukhi’s The Grand Voyage and Gianfranco Rosi’s Fire at Sea.

Central Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and Anatolia (Turkey) came under the sway of Islam leading to the emergence of three major Islamic civilization that dominated and enlightened the old world for several centuries.

As we try and maintain social distance from other bodies, wear masks to disrupt the virus’ pathways of diffusion, confront shortages in grocery stores, home supply outlets, and car dealerships, adjust to interruptions in many services, and either choose to, or are forced to stay at home, in our cities, in our countries, we are thinking and acting spatially. And we are reminded that “stuff”—food, medicines, toilet paper—reaches us often through geographically extensive and logistically intricate webs of economic production and distribution.

We will learn what it means to think geographically about the capitalist economy as a spatial, relational formation. In doing so, we will challenge dominant ways of understanding and analyzing the economy, and of what counts as economic. We will also examine two simultaneous aspects of the world economy—fixity and flow. On the one hand, the economy propels and is propelled by flows—of goods, of services, of people, of labor, and of finance. On the other hand, physical infrastructures are rooted in place on the earth. After all, even the digital worlds of Facebook, Google, and Amazon are enabled by vast server farms. The course will also highlight the production and proliferation of inequalities—between social groups, states, countries, and regions—in and by the world economy. In fact, we will ask: Is economic unevenness a mere byproduct of capitalist economic growth, or the condition of possibility for it? Finally, we will discuss the relationships between global phenomena and local events. Crises like global climate change, overflows of waste matter, COVID19, and the 2008 financial meltdown make it clear that the global and the local are intimately entangled. Not only do global events impact individual livelihoods, including yours and mine, but economic jitters in one place can escalate, sending shockwaves across the world.

Students will work together on a current social justice issue -- with both local and global implications -- designing their own responses to that issue.  Through this hands-on case study, we will unpack the tools and strategies of social justice movements, use interdisciplinary perspectives to investigate structural causes and key actors, imagine what change would look like and identify tactics for bringing about that change.

We will focus on novels from a variety of national contexts from the Global North and South to show how literary analysis can be a companion to the social sciences in illuminating the historical and social contexts of the nation-state. In addition, we will consider the function of literature in allowing stateless nations to imagine a shared connection. We will also focus on the inner workings of the novel in order to understand the conventions and mechanisms of the genre and how it interconnects with related forms such as cinema, performance, and the visual arts.

Students will critically engage with various paradigms on the geopolitical, racial, and gender power dynamics that anchor migration processes and outcomes. Why would the movement of individuals from some parts of the world (often from the least developed regions to the highly developed Western nations) create such strong and highly charged debates? How are cross border social and economic relations of individuals and households maintained and perpetuated? What are particular governments doing to either encourage or hinder these movements? How are current migrations different from earlier eras? Is this gendered, and if so, how and why? The objective of this course is to explore the above questions through academic and policy published literature.

To counter this imagined whiteness, students will be reading histories and Black authors’ experiences in these nations. A closer investigation will show that Black people have been traveling to Europe (willingly and unwillingly) for centuries. While Afro-Europeans remain at the margins of these nations, they find avenues to survive and thrive in the face of microaggressions and racism. As the semester progresses, we will examine the following questions: What is daily life like in a majority white country? In what ways are these authors included or excluded from national discourses? What ways do they bring attention to anti-Blackness in their local contexts? How do they define home and belonging? These questions will help us understand the imagined citizens of Central Europe and the people trying to tear these false images down.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Spring Even Year"

These ideas are historically and culturally specific. This course looks at body modification on a transnational scale to ask how we come to know what differentiates ""mutilation"" from ""correction."" We ask how feminist, queer, and critical race theories illuminate these debates, reading across historical, anthropological, medical and literary texts. Weekly topics include gender, race and cosmetic surgery; skin whitening technologies; transnational gender reassignment; surgical tourism; female genital cutting; piercing, tattooing and scarification; the cultural politics of hair; and body modification in the context of transnational feminized labor.","3","3","No","1","3","A-F - A-F Grade Basis","-","Periodic Fall & Spring"

"HIST","1463","An Introduction to Imperialism in Asia, 1850-Present","Twin Cities","Organized around a series of themes, this course will begin with a broad overview of imperialism in Asia before diving into economics of empire, technologies of imperialism, race and gender, nationalism and the end of empire, and neocolonialism. Throughout, the class will center the history of present-day China, India, Southeast Asia, and Japan, emphasizing whenever possible the perspectives of those impacted by empire rather than those perpetuating it. As such, assigned readings focus on primary sources supplemented by relevant secondary research, with optional readings providing significant breadth and depth for interested students seeking to delve further into their own interests or find new avenues of scholarly inquiry. All told, the histories included here represent some of the most significant events in recent centuries, but ones that often go overlooked in an academic context, covered only as a footnote in the histories of the West. Instead, this course will center the history of Asia and the voices of those impacted by imperialism, offering new perspectives on some of the most significant moments that shaped-and continue to shape-our contemporary world. 

Designed as an introductory course for those unfamiliar with the history of Asia, this class approaches a broad geographic and temporal range through case studies, diving deeply into crucial historical moments rather than providing an exhaustive overview of more than two centuries of Western imperialism. Simultaneously, this class will introduce students to the process of historical analysis itself using a substantial focus on primary sources, instructional time spent in libraries and archives, and a well-supported, intensive research essay process as a way to encourage them to think critically about the historical project while also honing their own historiographical skills. Overall, students will leave this course with a strong foundation in the history of Asia and the history of Western imperialism along with real practice “doing” history, preparing them for their future within the Department of History, at the University of Minnesota, and beyond.

The novel traces the journey of four pilgrims—a hapless monk, a mischievous monkey, a gluttonous pig, and a sand spirt—from China to India to gain Buddhist scriptures. They have many humorous adventures (there is nothing quite like humor to demonstrate the impermanence of things). The story of the Monkey King has been beloved by Chinese readers, theater goers, movie patrons, and television audiences for centuries. We will begin by reading a modern abridgement of the novel. We will look at questions such as: What is the nature of the humor in the novel? Why has the Monkey King been such a beloved figure in Chinese popular culture? What can we learn about Chinese society from this novel and its adaptations?

Wherever there was trade, wherever there was movement on the seas, there was piracy. Recent scholarship on the Mediterranean has focused on connectivities, micro-environments, the uniqueness of islands, and various climatic spheres in a geographic tradition that follows the path-breaking work of Fernand Braudel. This course will consider the urban and rural dimensions of the Mediterranean region as they relate to the history of merchants and pirates. Finally, the political and military aspects of Mediterranean history will be examined. There was a continuum from piracy to privateering to war.

In South Africa, we have seen the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures implemented to control it causing massive social upheaval and personal distress. It has forced the people in the country to confront issues that life prior to the pandemic had made easy to turn away from. Misogyny, gender based violence and sexual violence – a long-standing emergency in the south of Africa – have been forced into our vision once again. It was not the pandemic that created this violence. Nor was it the first time people had been outraged by a lack of action to address it. In the years approaching 2020, calls, protests and demonstrations were increasingly demanding the culture of impunity in gender based violence be ended; sometime with violent outcomes against the protestors themselves. Over those same years, nationwide protests have rocked South Africa’s university campuses. The student movements known as #RhodesMustFall, #FeesMustFall and #RUReferenceList highlight the contrasts and disappointments of the recent past in South Africa, confront the legacy of racism and misogyny in its institutions and knowledge systems, and resonate with a history of anti-racism and struggle that now, in turn, similarly fuel the on-going Black Lives Matter and #MeToo movements worldwide.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Periodic Fall"

As a strategy of being, these contemporary artists seem to use art to engage their audiences in a dynamic dialogue concerning certain aspects of contemporary life. These and other artists want to interpret political reality in order to change it; that is, to bring about social and political transformation through aesthetic means. This course will provide an overview of the ideas, strategies, and work of the artists as a critical lens for viewing the changing cultural and political landscape of an increasingly technological and globalized world.

This course will take a comparative studies approach to the development of contemporary art in its historical, its social and political contexts, the increasing influence of the Western art in Asia, Africa, and other parts of the world, and the cross-cultural communication customs and protocols of international art practice and art criticism. Methodologically, this course first aims at integrating four major disciplinary approaches in discussing art history from post-WWII to the present day: historical studies, sociological studies, psychoanalytic studies and cultural studies.

The classes will progress by way of interactive discussion and critical readings of historical documents and legal texts. 

This course is designed to break through the traditional Chinese learning/western learning dichotomy and interpret legal cases, political events, and cultural phenomena from a comparative perspective. It will bring to light the hidden rationales underscoring historical and ideological narratives, and will explain how frequent misunderstandings can occur when comparing cultures.

The MIT is an economic development situation in which a country attains a certain income due to given advantages and then gets “stuck” at that level.  The term was introduced by the World Bank in 2007 and is defined as the ""middle-income range"" countries with gross national product per capita that has remained between $1,000 to $12,000 at constant (2011) prices.  Students will study this phenomenon in general and then more specifically with respect to the economies of Argentina and Chile. These countries provide a unique opportunity to compare and contrast very different economic policies within the context of this phenomenon. With better understanding of the causes and consequences of the MIT, the course then seeks to better understand actions that can potentially alleviate the MIT and return economies to a path of growth. Within this context, student groups will be partnered with a company/organization located in Argentina or Chile to learn more about how they can create opportunities for growth, especially in situations where there are social, political, and economic challenges.","4","4","No","1","4","A-F - A-F Grade Basis","-","Every Fall"

While concentrated largely on residential neighborhoods within the Capital, Rome, the seminar includes a three-day excursion to Matera and Alberobello, the former in the central-southern region of Basilicata and the latter in southeastern Puglia, enabling students to consider the implications of two Southern Italian local economies largely dependent on tourism for survival and ponder the sustainability of each area. The seminar culminates in an extended day-long excursions to Naples, which contains the only continually inhabited city center in Italy, and will present a counter-example to the processes of revitalization and neighborhood transition witnessed in Rome and elsewhere, as well as provide an opportunity to synthesize information gathered thus far and apply it in a different context.","3","3","No","1","3","A-F - A-F Grade Basis","-","Every Summer"

As the event itself recedes into the past, our knowledge about the Holocaust has become increasingly shaped by literary and filmic representations of it. This course has several objectives: first, to deepen students' historical knowledge of the events and experiences of the Holocaust, and at the same time to introduce critical models for examining the relationship between personal experience, historical events, and forms of representation. This class will introduce students to the debates about the politics of memory and the artistic representation of the Holocaust, with special focus on public debates about the complex ways in which Holocaust memory surfaces in contemporary Germany and Austria, and by the accrual of layers of text and discourse about the Holocaust. We will explore the controversies and debates about public Holocaust memorialization in Germany, Austria, and the U.S. We will also explore the complex interplay between documentary and fictional accounts of the Holocaust, with attention paid to literary and film texts that challenge and ""remediate"" the limits of Holocaust representation. Additional topics will include Holocaust testimony; Holocaust memoirs, and 2nd and 3rd generation Holocaust literature, the Historians' Debate of the 1980s.

Over the course of the three weeks abroad, we will study the history and structure of the Afroasiatic languages found in Egypt. This includes extinct languages (old and middle Egyptian), liturgical languages (Coptic, Classical Arabic), vernacular languages (Egyptian Arabic, Siwi Berber) and standardized language (Modern Standard Arabic). We will investigate these languages through the lens of linguistic typology, a framework that explores the different types of grammatical patterns found in and across languages. With a particular focus on word formation and sentence structure, we will examine how the typological patterns relate to one another and how they can inform our understanding of human language more generally. When we step out of the classroom, we will see and hear these Egyptian languages and engage with the people who speak them. A secondary focus of this program will be linguistic methodology, and over the course of the program, students will practice three unique field research methods employed by linguists: formal elicitation sessions, rapid and anonymous surveys, and linguistic landscape documentation.

This introductory course explores both the enduring challenges of international politics as well as more recent transformative trends. The course introduces theoretical traditions, but its focus is on making sense of real-world problems, both today and in the past. Why is the world organized into states, and what implications does the states system have for indigenous populations globally? Why and when do states go to war and use military force? Why do they sign international agreements and treaties, on matters from arms control to investment? In what ways do existing systems of international law and trade exacerbate or mitigate global inequities? Why has human rights emerged as a central problem in world politics? What are the prospects for international cooperation to address climate change? How have inequities and prejudices, along the lines of race and other categorical identities, shaped our world - from the practice of global security to the structures of the international political economy? These are among the pressing real-world questions that this course in Global Politics will address and that it will give you the tools to answer - though particular instructors will naturally emphasize different topics and questions. But the course will also highlight how our answers to these questions are changing along with the deep power structures of global politics - as US dominance wanes and others, most notably China, rise; as core ideas and discourses underpinning the international system, such as sovereignty, come under assault; as institutions, such as those governing international law, thicken; and as attention grows to the structuring effects of race and other ascriptive categories.

Why does democracy emerge in some countries, while dictators hold onto power elsewhere? How do attitudes about gender and sexuality influence politics? Do particular religions, or the strength of religious faith, strengthen or weaken democracy? The readings and assignments help you make sense of the complexity of world politics - to sift through and distill the avalanche of information available and learn how to develop your own arguments about pertinent global issues. 

Upon completion of this course you will be able to understand and provide examples of 1) the difference between strong and weak states; 2) the distinctions between democratic and non-democratic forms of government; 3) the various ways democracies are governed; 4) arguments explaining the origin of democracy and the persistence of non-democracy; 5) the significance of different forms of political identity such as ethnicity, religion, and gender; 6) why some countries are rich while others remain poor; and 7) why some countries tax and spend more than others.

This course seeks to provide an introductory survey of Chinese politics, starting with the Republican revolution in the early 20th century, and ending with critical challenges in the current era. Throughout the semester, we will be juxtaposing historical lessons with contemporary reflections on different themes, ranging from revolution, state power, socioeconomic reform and development, civil society, and foreign relations. We will be examining a diverse set of perspectives from political leaders, scholars, and everyday citizens, through a combination of academic analyses, nonfiction reporting, primary sources, and other mediums. The goal for this course is to not only familiarize students with important issues facing Chinese political leaders and citizens at both the domestic and international level today, but to also provide students with a historicized and grounded approach towards the study of Chinese politics and society.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Spring"

Why have some countries in the post-colonial world, in particular, those of East Asia, experienced stunning economic growth, while those in other parts have not? We will explore inequality among nations through an engagement with competing explanations from multiple disciplines. Do free markets, the legacies of colonialism, state power, culture, or geography offer the most persuasive account of current patterns of global inequality? The course also examines what we mean by ""development"" and exposes students to cutting-edge debates in contemporary development studies. By the end of the course, students will have a better understanding of the causes of and possible solutions to global inequality.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Fall, Spring & Summer"
"POL","3479","Latin American Politics","Twin Cities","This course offers an introduction to the political history and contemporary politics of Latin America, along with some of the main concepts and theories used by social scientists to explain the region’s political dynamics. Through a comparative, historical approach, the course aims to help students understand the continued challenges faced by countries in the region-- to the establishment of security, the rule of law and rights protection, to the stability and quality of democracy, and to sustainable and equitable economic growth—and how these interact. The objective of the course is not only to help students understand the similarities and differences in outcomes in Latin America over time, but also to reflect on what the region’s experiences can teach us about the requirements of and barriers to meaningful democracy and sustainable and equitable development around the world, including “north of the border.” In other words, the course seeks not just to provide students’ knowledge about Latin America, but to help them learn from Latin America.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Fall"
"POL","3835","International Relations","Twin Cities","Why do countries go to war? Are individuals, organizations, and states driven by their interests or their ideas? What role does power play in international relations and is there any role for justice in global politics? Do international laws and transnational advocacy groups matter in a world dominated by powerful states? Whose interests are served by a globalizing world economy? These questions are central to the study of international relations, yet different theoretical approaches have been developed in an attempt to answer them. Often these approaches disagree with one another, leading to markedly different policy prescriptions and predictions for future events. This course provides the conceptual and theoretical means for analyzing these issues, processes, and events in international politics. By the end of this class, you will be able to understand the assumptions, the logics, and the implications of major theories and concepts of international relations. These include realism and neorealism, liberalism and liberal institutionalism, constructivism, feminism, Marxism, and critical theory. A special effort is made to relate the course material to world events, developments, or conflicts in the past decade or so.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Fall, Spring & Summer"
"POL","4255","Comparative Real Time Political Analysis: Marxist versus Liberal Perspectives","Twin Cities","Karl Marx and Frederick Engels had better democratic credentials than Alexis de Tocqueville and John Stuart Mill.  Vladimir Lenin, too, had better democratic credentials than Max Weber and Woodrow Wilson.  That’s the provocative argument of this course.  Performing what it calls “comparative real-time political analysis,” it presents convincing evidence to sustain both claims.  When the two sets of protagonists are compared and contrasted in how they read and responded to big political events in motion, in real-time, the Marxists, it contends, proved to be better democrats than the Liberals.  Real-time analysis argues that responding to and making decisions about events in motion is the real test of political perspective and theory; on Monday morning, we can all look smart.  The writings and actions of all seven protagonists are the primary course materials—reading them in their own words.  The European Spring of 1848, the United States Civil War, the 1905 Russian Revolution and, the 1917 Russian Revolution and end of World War I, all consequential in the democratic quest, are the main scenarios the course employs to test its claims.  The findings, course participants will learn, challenge assumed political wisdom like never before.  Employing the lessons of the comparisons to trying to make sense of current politics—given the unprecedented moment in which we find ourselves—is the other goal of the course.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Spring"
"POL","4463","The Cuban Revolution Through the Words of Cuban Revolutionaries","Twin Cities","Why do policy makers in Washington, D.C. continue to rail against the Cuban Revolution?  Despite their best efforts, both Republican and Democratic administrations, the Revolution is still in place after six decades.  How to explain?  This is the central research question of the course.  A definitive answer would require a thorough examination of the revolution from its initiation until today—which is beyond what can be done in a semester.  The focus, rather, is more limited.  First, how was the revolution made and consolidated—from 1953 until about 1969—and, second, how has it been able to survive and advance since the collapse of the Soviet Union, that is, since 1991?  The emphasis here is on the role of leadership and strategy, how the Cubans and their leaders saw and see what they are doing—in their own words.   This is an attempt to get into their heads, their understandings, through documents, speeches and writings. 

In keeping with the goals of liberal education, this course helps students to think outside the box of conventional wisdom.  Why, for example, an underdeveloped society lacking many of the characteristics of a liberal democracy can do a better job in meeting the basic needs of its citizens than its far richer neighbor to the north? What the Cubans seek to do is reorganize human relations on the basis of solidarity and not individual self-interest.  How successful they have been in that pursuit is exactly one of the questions to which the course seeks to provide an answer.  These questions are not simply of intellectual interest.  Given the deepening crisis of world capitalism with the accompanying human misery, to know about Cuba's reality can have life and death consequences.  Given, also, that the U.S. government doesn’t make it easy for most of its citizens to travel to the island to make up their own minds about its reality, this course is a unique educational opportunity.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Fall"

"SPPT","1904","Latin American Cinema","Twin Cities","Since the 1960s, there has been a tension in Latin American cinema: should it portray the region in exoticized, picturesque ways that incite delight or should it reveal economic inequalities and incite outrage? The first form of cinema has been more commercially successful at home and abroad. The second has put Latin America on the map as a major site of experimental radical cinema full of stylistic innovation and severe attacks of authoritarianism and global capitalism. Both styles of cinema address how Latin American filmmakers choose to represent their specific countries and the collective postcolonial realities of the region more generally. In this class, you will be introduced to film studies basics (camera angle, composition, lighting, montage, sound, story, and so forth) as they relate to Latin America cinema.

The content of this course will employ a cultural, literary, and film studies approach to exploring the development and representation of Australian identity through the lens of film, drama, and literature. The course will be a 3-week long study abroad course with pre-departure readings and films, on-site readings and activities, and a final project due upon return.
Australia is an isolated place considered to be on the ""edge of the world,"" simultaneously the oldest continent and a young civil society. It is a place evocative of wild stunning landscape, exotic wildlife, and a history as a convict colony. Since the birth of the Australian film industry in the 1950's Australian filmmakers have sought to tell their own stories and to interrogate the idea of Australian culture. The global success of films such as Mad Max, Crocodile Dundee, and Priscilla Queen of the Desert have served to reinforce and disrupt stereotypes of Australia as a place and culture. In contrast, films such as Rabbit Proof Fence, Animal Kingdom and The Sapphires seek to tell alternative narratives. Themes such as the urban and rural divide, conquering nature, the place in society of indigenous communities, and fatalism are interrogated
Similarly, Australian writers such as Colleen McCullugh, Kate Grenville, Tim Winton, and Liane Morriarty have gained international readership. Their novels, as well as others, use landscape and storytelling to create and challenge simplistic ideas of Australian history and culture.
By studying the history and works engaged in creating and interpreting this idea of Australian identity, from Australian artists, students will be asked to engage in a more complex way with the ideas of heritage, culture, and national identity in general. Students will also read selected essays on Australian history and culture. The IDI (Intercultural Development Inventory) will also be used as a tool to engage with the dialogue on identity and culture in general.","3","3","No","1","3","A-F - A-F Grade Basis","-","Periodic Spring"

"YOST","3012","Decolonizing Ireland: Youth and Community Revitalization","Twin Cities","In this class, students are invited to investigate the world from varied historical perspectives, learn new ways of thinking, and grow as active citizens and lifelong learners for the 21st century. In particular, students will explore the concepts of indigeneity and colonialism within the context of youth and community work in Ireland. While many narrate Ireland as a site of political conflict and reconciliation, this course takes a more holistic, historic, and futuristic perspective. Over centuries, Ireland has experienced successive waves of colonization most notably, and recently, by the English. Hallinan (1977) wrote “if Ireland can claim any special place in the history of colonialism, it is that of a laboratory and testing ground for policies that would be applied at a later date, in different times and places.” Irish colonization served as the blueprint for settler colonialism around the globe and resulted in a paradox wherein the Irish diaspora transitioned to a privileged colonizer status. At the same time, the Irish in Ireland, remained occupied, both experiencing and carrying the legacy of intergenerational trauma. Over the past few decades, Irish peoples in Ireland, often under the auspices of youth and community work in rural and Gaelic speaking areas, have engaged in a project of re-indigenization. Partnering with and hosting Indigenous peoples from around the globe, Ireland is reclaiming its indigeneity; revitalizing pre-colonial culture, governance structures, language, ecologies, and lifeways. 

Students will engage this content using tested practices of experiential and place-based learning grounded in the traditions of youth and community work. We will learn, on the land and in community, about the ways that colonization changed both people and place. To best understand these experiences and impacts, students will learn alongside youth and community workers in gaeltacht (gaelic speaking) regions. They will walk the land, listen to its stories, and feel its revitalization. For example, students might visit the emigration museum to view ship manifests or walk the Bridge of Tears, take a wee dander to learn Irish traditional ecological knowledge, attend a nature-based healing in the local eas (waterfall), work alongside community members to restore the ancient oak forest, learn from the hawthorn and hazel in the tradition of an Irish forest school, or explore ancient rites of passage and ceremony. Students will close their time in Ireland by revisiting common narrations of Ireland as a site of political conflict and reconciliation in comparison to the Indigenous Ireland movement: an ongoing movement to reclaim and revitalize Irish land, language, and lifeways and to build relationships with and responsibility to other international Indigenous communities.
