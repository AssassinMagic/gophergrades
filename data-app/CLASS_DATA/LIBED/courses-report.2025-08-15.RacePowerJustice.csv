"AAS","1101","Imagining Asian America","Twin Cities","What are the histories, cultures, and experiences of Asian Americans, the fastest-growing group in the United States? How do they fit into the U.S.'s history of immigration, race, and citizenship? Is the ""model minority"" myth really true? This course is an introduction to Asian American Studies, an interdisciplinary field that uses ethnography, literature, histories, films, memoirs, and other texts to study how the history of Asian immigration to the United States has visibly shaped existing Asian American communities and identities, and how ""Asian America"" is central to a more general understanding of American popular culture and public life.

The course is roughly organized chronologically. We will first begin with an introduction to the field of Asian American Studies by asking the questions: What is Asian America? What is Asian American Studies? We will then examine important concepts, categories, and processes before exploring the rich history of Asian migration to the United States and contemporary issues facing Asian Americans today. 

One of the core principles of this course is to encourage active and interdisciplinary learning. This means that we will be learning in a variety of ways to explore and understand the material (reading, writing, watching, listening, seeing, discussing, presenting). We will be drawing from a wide range of disciplines (history, law, sociology, education, cultural studies, psychology, etc.). And we will be using a variety of materials (memoir, scholarly articles, historical documents, government records, newspapers, films, photographs, popular culture, etc.) Your active participation in these activities is essential.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Fall"
"AAS","1201","Racial Formation and Transformation in the United States","Twin Cities","What does it take to discuss race seriously? An exploration of this question demands a counter-narrative, for our contemporary moment is such that a growing public opinion (1) casts America as a “raceless nation,” (2) interprets antiracism as “reverse racism,” and (3) embraces “diversity” to maintain the racial status quo. As a class, we will explore what it means to treat race as a social construct and also a central organizing principle shaping patterns of power and inequality. Talking about race is not easy to be sure; it engenders a host of unsettling emotions ranging from guilt and shame to anger. Yet not talking about race as a social fact in American life and culture merely reinforces the existing racial hierarchy. It forecloses opportunities to reach across boundaries of social difference to strive toward a shared sense of community and belonging. Together, we will participate in racial struggles, albeit at times painful and challenging, to address and grapple with ethical-political imperatives to pursue social justice and make the notion of diversity anew. Together we will reckon with the role of institutions in conditioning the material realities of racialized groups, while also recognizing the capacity of racialized groups to resist regimes of racial power.","3","3","No","1","3","A-F - A-F Grade Basis","-","Periodic Fall & Spring"

"AAS","3301","Asian America Through Arts and Culture","Twin Cities","Americans of Asian descent comprise one of the fastest-growing racial groups in the U.S. today. While large numbers of Asian Americans have been in the U.S. since the middle of the nineteenth century, it is only in the past few decades that they have been widely recognized in art, culture, and media. This course focuses on how writing, art, performance, film, and/or other works of culture registers the experiences of Asian Americans past and present. How do individual artists or writers depict themselves and others as part of families, communities, or nations? How do questions of race, racism, family, identity, immigration, labor, citizenship, inequality, gender, sexuality, media stereotypes, and activism affect the perspectives and the creative choices in these works?","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Spring Even Year"
"AAS","3341","Asian American Images","Twin Cities","From 19th-century anti-Chinese political cartoons to Harold and Kumar, visual representations of Asians in the United States have long influenced how Asian Americans are seen and treated. What are some of the ways that photography, graphic arts, and digital culture have pictured Asian Americans as aliens, citizens, immigrants, workers, family and community members, entertainers, and artists? Course topics will relate visual images to particular historical moments, including the early exclusion period and the ""yellow peril"" stereotype; WWII Japanese American incarceration and the drawings of Miné Okubo, and photo-journalism documenting U.S. military involvement in Southeast Asia and its aftermath. How do photographic and other images work to counter historical amnesia, heal traumatic loss, and document social injustice? Other weeks of the class will explore the ways that individuals, families, and communities use photographs, video, and other visual media to preserve a sense of connection and belonging. We will also look at how contemporary Asian American photographers such as Tseng Kwong Chi, Nikki Lee, and Wing Young Huie experiment with visual images to raise questions of racial and national identity, social inequality, gender, sexuality, and political agency. The course also includes a digital storytelling project that encourages students to create video images and sound reflecting Asian American immigration stories from local communities.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Periodic Fall & Spring"
"AAS","3351","Asian Americans and Popular Culture","Twin Cities","Over the past few decades, Asian Americans have become increasingly visible both as the subjects and producers of popular culture in the United States. This course will explore how this new recognition of Asian Americans in popular literature, cinema, television, and entertainment is related both to longer histories of Asian immigration and racial exclusion and to post-1960s efforts to forward racial awareness, community activism, and social justice. Our first unit will look at how particular stereotypes such as the yellow peril or the wartime enemy encouraged anti-Asian feeling and violence and legal restrictions on immigration and naturalization. We will then examine how throughout history, Asian immigrants and their descendants used song, dance, theater, writing, and other forms of popular culture to express personal desires and foster collective ties. Our final unit concentrates on contemporary popular culture and its relationship to the changing identities of Asian Americans. How do Asian Americans influence the current essays, films, and videos that are consumed by millions today? How are increasingly pan-ethnic, interracial, multiracial, transnational, and global experiences reflected in popular culture?","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Periodic Fall & Spring"
"AAS","3503","Asian American Identities, Families, & Communities","Twin Cities","This course provides a sociological overview of Asian American identities, families and communities. To place these experiences within a broader historical, structural, and cultural context the course will begin with a brief introduction to the history of Asians and Asian Americans in the United States and sociological theories about incorporation and racial stratification. We will then examine the diversity of Asian American communities and families, highlighting ethnic, gender, and class variations. Other topics of focus include racialization and discrimination, education, ethnic enclaves, family and intergenerational relationships, identity, media, culture, and politics and social action. Throughout the course we will consider the ways in which society affects individuals, and how in turn, individuals affect society.

Module 1 will provide the opportunity for students to investigate contemporary and historical manifestations oppression and inequities within Agricultural, Food and Natural Resource Sciences (AFNR) with a special focus on community and educational spaces. Module 2 will support students to explore oppression, power, privilege, and white supremacy. Students will explore how these show in society at large, as well as how they personally embody and enact these very things. Module 3 will prompt students to consider the nature of knowledge that is legitimized and knowledge that is suppressed. We will then learn about diverse knowledge systems and decolonizing work. Module 4 will support students to explore culture, identity, intersectionality, and positionality – their own and those of other cultural groups. We will consider how some cultures are lifted while others are marginalized in different spaces. Module 5 brings us to learning about methods of bring culturally responsive and anti-racist in AFNR work in educational and community spaces.

"AFRO","1011","Introduction to African American Studies","Twin Cities","This course is an introduction to the study of people of African descent in the United States with linkages to Africa and connections to the African diaspora. We will explore why people of African descent have occupied an oppressed position in this culture and globally and how they have resisted this oppression creating social change. Our major form of analysis is historical sociology, as well as the arts and humanities. We will examine changes over time and employ sociological, economic, cultural, and political tools for understanding the historical and contemporary positioning of African Americans. We will be centrally concerned with how domination, race, gender, and class shape Black life in the U.S. and how resistance and change have occurred. In our analyses we take seriously the deep intersectionality of systems of oppression as well as historic resistance to oppression. Critical race theory and Black feminist theory are important frames for our work. Moreover, the significance of the cultural creativity of African peoples is foundational to our understanding. We must be concerned with how Black people see themselves today. How social change is imagined in the 21st century informs our work.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Spring"

"AFRO","3301","The Music of Black Americans","Twin Cities","This course examines the variety of ways African and African Americans express social history through music. It will consider the union of African elements and European elements that combined to present a new syncretized African-American product. To do this it is imperative that we explore the diversity of musical “voices” found within the African American culture. This diversity can be seen in the struggles to retain African cultural effects and the desire to be eclectic, creative, and contemporary. Such an approach to the study of the place of Black music in American music corresponds with the criteria of Diversity and Social Justice in the United States Liberal Education. The “multi-layered operation of power, prestige, and privilege” can be understood through an examination of the music of African Americans, which represents both a Free African voice and an enslaved African voice; the western-trained Black performer/composer and the self-taught performer/composer. It also represents the habits of well-to-do African Americans and the poor African Americans. Students will examine the complexities of the history of African Americans and how this is played out in the development of musical styles and genres. From this, students will then begin to understand how this unique diversity within a community affects those outside of those communities. Such an approach to the study of the place of Black music in American music corresponds with the criteria of Diversity and Social Justice in the United States Liberal Education.

We will follow elements found in West African culture and music such as ""call and response"" and the ""2nd Line"" as they travel to the ""New World"" and expressed through Spirituals, Symphonies, Gospel Music, Jazz, Rock and Roll, Step Bands and more. Through lectures, readings, discussion, audiovisual examples, and homework assignments student can expect to gain a deeper understanding of the ways music both reflects and influences the social history of all Americans.","3","3","No","1","3","A-F - A-F Grade Basis","-","Every Fall, Spring & Summer"

In recent years we have become accustomed to hearing about and debating the efficacy of the term and movement ""Black Lives Matter,"" but what, other than precarity, constitutes these lives that matter? How have black people collectively thrived even under conditions that would assume otherwise? In this course we will consider the myriad ways black people have gone about creating, dreaming, struggling, building, educating, loving, and living, even in the midst of all that works to bring death near. We will explore a range of cultural forms, including stand-up comedy, hip hop and R&B music, reality television, social media, and film, in order to contemplate the urgency and necessity of black social life, or, what it means to be with and for black people.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Spring"
"AMES","3766","Hmong Textiles and Identities","Twin Cities","This is a lecture, discussion, and project-based learning course on the multi-faceted Hmong identities throughout regions of different countries, time-periods, and acculturation process of each region. The course analyzes authentic materials, texts, and media about the utilization of Artistic Textiles as well as Functional Textiles (clothing) in everyday Hmong life as well as identity frameworks. Hmong textiles and embroideries are key elements to Hmong identities, and directly reflect the diaspora, culture, location, dialect, and practice of each group and sub-group. International Hmong identities are identified and studied in order to critically analyze the foundations of the Hmong American identity. Students learn how to interpret each region's textiles and embroideries and how they represent embroidered language and identities. Although there will be a focus on Asia, this class also focuses on an international Hmong identity which includes the United States and other countries of the Hmong diasporic journey. The class analyzes the role textiles play in today's international Hmong population, Hmong ethnic identity, transformation, advancement, social justice, and commodification. This course is taught in English, there are no prerequisites, and students are not required to have taken any Hmong language classes.

"AMES","3867","Orientalism and the Arab World","Twin Cities","This course explores the various manners in which “the Arab World” is constructed and re/presented in American and European discourses. Reading through scholarly writings, literature, visual arts, and popular media, this course illuminates the manner in which the idea of a monolithic “Arab World” and quintessential “Arab” subject are constructed and re/produced for western consumption. Crucially, this course also examines the manner in which this re/production of the “Arab World/Subject” is integral to the construction of western identity itself – serving as a foil to western self-conceptualization. 

The concept of orientalism was introduced into western scholarship by Edward Said through his seminal 1978 work, Orientalism, often credited as a foundational text in the field of postcolonial studies. In the first part of the course, we will closely read Orientalism and some of the influential critical engagements with Said’s book. We will also discuss how orientalist discourse has been subsumed under the debates on the “Clash of Civilizations” and “The War on Terror” in the 21st century. The second part of the course will look at orientalist representations in a variety of mediums, from literature and visual art to video games. In the final part of the course, we will try to “inventory the traces” of Orientalism on the Oriental subject, or examine the manner Arab artists and writers have engaged with orientalism’s legacies.

Thus, the individual family members are not only transformed into productive citizens but are also tasked with the responsibility to reproduce the nation(alism). For example, the recent advancement for gay marriage is scripted as a new phenomenon that poses as both a threat to the American values and a sign of progress.

Drawing on political organizing by women of color during the recent Black Lives Matter uprising, we consider what it means to make and claim space as women of color in politics.  We also look at how rage - BIPOC women's rage, white rage, rage against women - gets mobilized to cement and/or combat racism, xenophobia, and misogyny.

"APEC","3081","Perspectives on Economic and Social Issues Affecting Indigenous Communities","Twin Cities","Indigenous peoples--in the sense, loosely speaking, of original or early settled populations living in nations now politically and socially dominated by later-arriving populations--can be found in significant numbers in many countries, especially those founded in settler colonialism. They often live in socially, racially, and culturally distinct, not-fully-assimilated communities, sometimes with special legal, political, spatial, cultural, and other status or rights. In those cases, these communities are likely also to face special economic constraints and opportunities, and these in turn often intersect with concepts of race and identity as well as issues of social justice and power. 

This course will analyze the historical and contemporary factors that have contributed to the special economic circumstances and institutions of Indigenous communities. It will touch on Indigenous community issues worldwide but will focus on the United States and, to some extent, Minnesota. Students will gain an understanding of Indigenous communities' economic resources, such as land, knowledge, health, financial capital, social capital, environmental capital, and political and legal rights. They will examine the special legal and institutional constraints limiting the efficient use of these resources and discuss policy issues related to the development of Indigenous economies. A mixture of economic concepts and theory, data, and case studies will be used throughout the course. 

In keeping with this course's liberal education objectives, this course asks students to learn and use multiple disciplines to critically and rationally analyze the economic opportunities and challenges facing Indigenous communities and to demonstrate how economic concepts and evidence shed light on related issues of equity and justice. This course draws on literature from history, law, biology, psychology, many subfields of economics (microeconomics, development economics; regional and spatial economics; the economics of human capital, economic history, etc.), and more. Students will learn how to use economic reasoning to better understand the history of interactions between Indigenous people and settler societies. They will learn about and use some of the available data on Indigenous people and communities to better understand the communities' economic situations as well as the limitations of the data and data analysis. They will be asked to discuss how concepts of racial identity and power differences between settler and Indigenous communities emerged and contributed to modern Indigenous economic outcomes and to use economic reasoning in discussing the related justice issues.

"BA","3001","Race, Power, and Justice in Business","Twin Cities","The United States is a diverse nation founded on the principle of equality, and yet has roots in slavery, indigenous genocide, colonialism, and dispossession. These roots shaped economic relations and business practices that continue today. Rather than seeing business as historical organizations in which bundles of functional practices seek economic efficiency and respond to idealized market conditions, this course considers the socially-embedded nature of business in which racial and other structural inequalities are inherent in the development and contemporary practice of business. This includes questioning standard assumptions of free markets, meritocracy, and equal opportunity by considering alternative models of social relations and discrimination, and evidence on systemic economic injustice that reflect power differences, the contested nature of race, and the intersection of race, class, and other marginalized identities. This course also reveals ways in which business practices reflect hidden power dynamics and stereotypes.

This deeper understanding of how race, power, and justice issues are fundamental to business and management is intended to provide students with a richer lens to more critically examine business practices while considering ways to address power hierarchies and promote social justice in the context of business. This includes a consideration of alternative business practices as well as how corporations can advance diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). To complete the progression from macro-level structural and historical issues and then mid-level organization practices, the course concludes with an individual-level focus that considers how individuals navigate social identity differences at work, the impact of personal bias, and how to be an ally to advance justice and DEI. The course culminates with personal development plans in which students will demonstrate their belief in their own agency by devising plans for addressing their own biases and for identifying specific actions they can use to address power hierarchies and promote social justice.  

By providing a common experience for all Carlson School undergraduate students, this course also provides a shared vocabulary and diversity of perspectives to facilitate a shared sense of responsibility to build and maintain community as well as fostering openness to ongoing, respectful conversations on race, identity, power, and injustice.

An exploration of this question demands a counter-narrative, for our contemporary moment is such that a growing public opinion (1) casts America as a “raceless nation,” (2) interprets antiracism as “reverse racism,” and (3) embraces “diversity” to maintain the racial status quo. Talking about race is not easy to be sure; it engenders a host of unsettling emotions ranging from guilt and shame to anger. Yet not talking about race as a social fact in American life and culture merely reinforces the existing racial hierarchy. It forecloses opportunities to reach across boundaries of social difference to strive toward a shared sense of community and belonging. Together, we will participate in racial struggles, albeit at times painful and challenging, to address and grapple with ethical-political imperatives to pursue social justice and make the notion of diversity anew.

"CHIC","1915","What You Didn't Learn in High School History: Ethnic Studies","Twin Cities","This course seeks to act as a site in which open honest dialogue can take place regarding our shared stake in a multiracial society. This course will study race and ethnicity in order to rethink foundational ideas, histories, and movements in United States society and beyond.  An overriding theme of the course will be an examination of how power relations are constructed through racism and its tie to colonialism; and conversely, how racialized communities—particularly African American, Latin@/e, Asian American, and American Indian—are sites of survival and resistance. Therefore, a guiding question that we will explore and discuss collectively will be what role has/does race play in re-creating unequal and hierarchical social arrangements in U.S. society? Understanding that the practice of race is not a series of isolated events, but an institutional phenomenon that works on a societal level, we will ask further, what purposes has/is race used for? To what ends has race been applied to ascertain who has access to resources, who works where, and who is a legitimate member of U.S. society. Indeed, a number of scholars agree that race has been and continues to be used to maintain or reconstruct an unequal society, for the benefit of particular interests, in the form of systematic oppression, but Ethnic Studies scholars have also ascertained that Black, Indigenous, and brown communities have also responded to racial oppression in a myriad of ways and a diversity of peoples have challenged institutional and everyday racism. In light of this we will also ask, how have colonized people and their allies challenged, resisted, and accommodated racial oppression in U.S. society? In particular, the class will close out considering the movement for Ethnic Studies in the K-12 school system across the U.S. and the ways in which it does not only seek to add new voices and perspectives, but to rethink the approach to education generally as a transformative process. All in all, this course will analyze race and ethnicity to question and collectively address the limits and possibilities of a democratic society and seek to propose alternative practices that might make our society more democratic and egalitarian. Indeed, another emphasis of this course in regards to the larger inquire of democratic practice will be how racial and ethnic identities and social forces intersect with other categories such as class, gender, sexuality, and nationality. In these ways it is in the hope that students use these themes as a window into thinking critically about our society so that we might determine our own position in order to contribute to ongoing struggles for a better world.","3","3","No","1","3","A-F - A-F Grade Basis","001475","Periodic Fall"

Music, as a mode that both creates and reflects culture, provides key insight into political and social systems. Whether we are studying early border ballads by Chelo Silva who challenged gender norms or learning about Bad Bunny’s commitment to revitalizing Puerto Rico’s electrical grid after Hurricane Maria, we will focus on how the musical production impacts broader society. Readings from scholars in Chicana/o/x and Latina/o/x Studies will ground our analysis of music through an intersectional lens. We will unpack the race, class, and gender dynamics that are evident in a particular musical production. Moreover, we will analyze the artist’s positionality (identities in a particular context) to discuss issues of power and resistance. 

The course units are organized in a flexible chronology and by genre. The material ranges from traditional musical styles such as the corrido and bolero to contemporary genres like punk and hip hop. To fully immerse ourselves in Chicana/o/x and Latina/o/x music there are both reading assignments and listening assignments for each class session. When possible, there are also visuals (music videos) that will provide an additional layer for us to analyze. Throughout the semester you will write about individual songs, albums, music videos, and artists by applying course concepts and theories to the work.

We will pursue an intensive study of primary readings written by Karl Marx himself, exploring the social, philosophical, and political history of Marxist thought and familiarizing ourselves with key concepts such as labor-power, primitive accumulation, the commodity, use value, exchange-value, surplus-value, crisis, money, and capital. As we study Marx as a theoretician, we will also examine his work as a political revolutionary, writer, and correspondent with many of the most important revolutionary figures of his day. Here we will foreground his analysis of the labor of enslaved Black persons in the plantation economies of the Southern United States—which he ties to the labor markets of capitalism in Europe—as well as his more explicit critiques of slavery and colonialism.

Following this close reading of Marx and the Marxist tradition, we will consider the ways that critical thinkers and political activists, both in the United States and globally, continue to resist, create, and dream under the banner of Marxism throughout the twentieth century and into our own new century. We will center questions of racial justice through the writings of W. E. B. Du Bois and contemporary Marxist scholars of race, indigeneity, and diaspora, focusing on Du Bois’s attention to the links between race and social class in America. Alongside critical reappraisals of Marx’s thought, we shall think about the influence of Marx’s writings on political activists in the Black Panther Party and the American Indian Movement, and on American labor, as well as on South American revolutionaries like Carlos Marighella. We will then move to a study of Marxist feminism, linking race and gender in U.S. and global Marxisms through readings by Black Panther activist and intellectual Angela Davis, the social historian Nancy Fraser, and Italian Marxist feminist Silvia Federici. We will revisit the question of gender oppression and feminist resistance through a Marxist frame, with reference to the revival of socialist prospects in the work of Jodi Dean and Mackenzie Wark. Finally, we will examine the contemporary fight over reproductive rights and the history of the “Wages for Housework” movement.
From these readings and conversations we will think about how Marx’s ideas and their larger legacy can help us to understand our current moment and our political, social, and ecological futures. In as much as this is a course on theoretical perspectives, it will also be one that seeks to use Marx, and the Marxist tradition, to develop critical perspectives and solutions to pressing issues of racial injustice, social inequality, and environmental devastation.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Spring"

What do these labels mean, why are they applied, and do they ever cease to be applicable? Can we distinguish religion from culture, and what are the implications when we try? Why is it frequently asked whether Saul Bellow was ""really"" a Jewish writer, but it is impossible to read Philip Roth as anything other than that? How does Grace Paley's ""Jewishness"" come through even when she is writing about non-Jewish characters? We will address these issues and others as we explore the literature growing out of the Jewish immigrant experience in America, as well as the literature by Jewish writers more firmly, though still sometimes anxiously, rooted in American soil. In this course we will engage in a highly contextualized and historicized study of Jewish American literature from the 19th century to today.  We will discover in these texts how inherited Jewish culture and literary imaginings, developed over centuries of interaction between Jewish communities and the ""outside world,"" get reexamined, questioned, rejected, reimagined, reintegrated, and transformed within the crucible of American experience. The discussions that ensue will also provide a framework for engaging with the creative energies and cultural productivity of more recent immigrant communities in the United States and beyond. Immigration and the experience of immigrant communities continues to be at the forefront of American consciousness, as immigrants work to create new meanings and new narratives for their lives, and as those who immigrated before them provide contested meanings for the impact of immigration on their own narratives. This course, though grounded in Jewish narratives, will therefore provide students with an expanded vocabulary and perspective for engaging in this central and very current debate within the American experience.

"ENGL","3332","Black Times: Afrofuturism, Afropessimism and the Future (Ends) of the World","Twin Cities","In 1993, Mark Dery coined the term Afrofuturism to describe “[s]peculative fiction that treats African-American themes and addresses African-American concerns in the context of twentieth- century technoculture — and, more generally, African-American signification that appropriates images of technology and a prosthetically enhanced future."" At the same time, Dery places this fictional treatment of Black futures in the context of a history systematically denied. Afropessimism, on the other hand, emerges at the turn of the 21st century in an interview between Saidiya Hartman and Frank B. Wilderson III as a meta theory that evinces a skepticism about the utility of the term Human to understand the positionality of blackness in an antiblack world. Blackness, for Afropessemists, becomes a technology by which the Human constitutes its Humanity as difference. This body of work generally understands the end of antiblackness as only possible with the destruction of “the world,” understood to be definitionally antiblack.

Starting with W.E.B. Du Bois’s “The Comet,” this course traces the relationships between African American literature, politics and sociality through the representation of blackness in relationship to technology. This course interrogates Dery’s description of Afro Futurism as both descriptive and ideological. Put another way, this class is attentive to the way that the future is signified in the contemporary world as well as the fact that, following Afropessimism’s analysis, that world, and thus this mode of signifying blackness, may itself be antiblack. As a result, this course juxtaposes traditionally, technologically, Afrofuturist works, with those such as Parable of the Sower, The Broken Earth Trilogy, and An Unkindness of Ghosts that depict Black futures at or after the apocalypse.

Students should expect to think and rethink the relationship between technology as a signifier of the future and those structures that continue antiblackness and colonialism. Additionally, students should also expect to gain a broad conceptualization of African American speculative fiction. Finally, students can expect to read texts of Black fiction that imagine futures in ways beyond the disasters of not only antiblackness, but of misogyny, heterosexism, ableism, and transphobia.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Spring Even Year"

"ENGL","3741","Literacy and American Cultural Diversity","Twin Cities","Literacy and American Cultural Diversity combines academic study with experiential learning in order to collectively build more engaged, more complex understandings of literacy, educational institutions, counter-institutional literacy programs, the grassroots and nonprofit sectors, and the struggles of a multicultural civil society in a putative democracy.  We will ground our inquiry in government studies, as well as sociological, historical, and educational writings. Standard literature, such as a memoir, a selection of poems, some short fiction, and a novel will further open up our twin themes of literacy and multiculturalism – as will less “official” literature, such as manifestos and the transcribed stories of immigrants, refugees, and other marginalized communities.

We begin with the basic understanding of literacy as reading and writing, noting that, according to the National Survey of Adult Literacy, 46% of Americans scored in the lowest two levels of a five-tiered literacy test. What does this mean? Are such tests accurate or otherwise helpful?   What about your basic literacy? As you read this syllabus, you’re making use of basic abilities that you’ve likely been practicing most of your life through formal schooling, daily routines, recreational pursuits, and work-related duties. But there’s more. On another level, you bring knowledge to your reading (some conscious, some unconscious), and the ideological field supplies you with assumptions about the role of literacy in your development, the role of a university course in your plans for your personal and professional life, and your position in a society that constantly raises the standards of literacy, basing success on your ability to keep up. Thus the very word “literacy” calls into play many beliefs we have about our class system, our cultural life, economic and political structures, and educational institutions. Accordingly, our analysis will move beyond basic “reading and writing” to wider concepts of literacy in our society, investigating issues that have much to do with our role as public citizens involved in shaping our individual and collective future.  In tandem with our “classroom” work, our service-learning work in the community (see Your Practicum as Literacy Workers, below) will enable us to develop more “tangible” understandings of the ways that literacy, educational theories, practices, and the construction of knowledge and skills through educational policies provide a “map” of the shifting socioeconomic, cultural, and political terrains of the U.S., the institutional inequities that result from these arrangements, as well as the justice work needed to transform those inequities.","4","4","No","1","4","OPN - Student Option No Audit","-","Every Fall & Spring"

In addition to studying research on the psychology of learning and diversity, we will survey literature about scientific communication and learn about the impact of disparities in educational opportunities. We will also engage in discussions about the persistent problems related to equity and access in STEM education.

In October, November, and December, the class meets at a local middle school (easily accessible by public transportation). University students lead introductory science demos, stage a science fair so the middle school students have a chance to play judge, and then partner with the middle school students as they invent, execute, and present their own science fair projects.

During September, and on school holidays in October and November, the class will discuss theories and research that explains the crisis being experienced across America and in particular, in the Twin Cities. They will design evidence-based curriculum materials to address key issues and have hands-on experiences as peer mentor-teachers. Overall, this class will provide experiences that are likely to be transformative in relation to students' views of education, opportunity, and the power of their involvement.  

This class builds on a partnership between the University of Minnesota and a local middle school. The overarching goal is to support students from groups typically underrepresented in science as they participate in an advanced science learning opportunity: the science fair. Our engagement with the school science fair process should result in an experience that motivates future participation in STEM opportunities.

Throughout the ages, throughout the world, music seems to have a special power to fill urban space with meaning. This is mostly why the music industry is always desperately trying to chase the new ways music is produced and consumed. Much about the rapid changes in the industry can be linked to changes taking place in the geography of cities and globalization. Through music, people feel connected to landscapes,  neighborhoods, buildings, and identities. Music gives value to places, so helps cement us/them divisions, a process easily seen (heard) in national anthems. This course tries to understand how the interplay exactly occurs between sounds, places, and differences through case studies from many genres.

Major immigration reform, transformations in the nation's educational and health care systems, along side new patterns of consumption and new forms of media were also products of the Sixties. From the Cold War to the Vietnam War, from anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism to third world revolutions, Americans transformed the world and the US was transformed by the world in the sixties.

This course will discuss how cinematic interpretations of American law have been perceived and accepted inside and outside Hollywood, inside and outside the legal community, and inside and outside the United States. The course will begin by teaching and discussing some fundamentals of American law, using legal films to illustrate the doctrinal concepts and processes involved in civil procedure, criminal law and procedure, jury trials, evidence, contracts, torts, constitutional law, the First Amendment, legal ethics, professional responsibility, etc. 
Using clips from of cinematic masterpieces, we will visualize and discuss sophisticated legal concepts.

"HSEM","3023H","Race: The History of an Idea in North America","Twin Cities","This Honors seminar explores the roots and rationales presented when constructing and upholding the idea of race. This class examines processes of racial formation in science, law, history, immigration policy, education, leisure, adoption, marriage, and medicine. The course investigates how Americans came to mythologize, understand, identify, and codify the importance of race since the mid-nineteenth century. Racial formations and classifications shift according to political climates, such that immigration debates, changing gender norms and concerns over interracial marriage transform how we imagine racial groups. We will also look at how race has been used to pathologize, eroticize, vilify, fetishize, and medicalize purported ‘problem people,’ like immigrants, the poor, and the sick. For instance, seeing people of color as particular hazards during pandemics, like the 1918 Influenza or 2020 COVID-19 crises, has deep roots in longstanding racial theories. Using memoirs, legal cases, history of medicine, laws, photographs, oral histories, and secondary source readings, this class traces the history of America’s fascination with race and how race came to define so many aspects of American life during the twentieth century.

What do these labels mean, why are they applied, and do they ever cease to be applicable? Can we distinguish religion from culture, and what are the implications when we try? Why is it frequently asked whether Saul Bellow was “really” a Jewish writer, but it is impossible to read Philip Roth as anything other than that? How does Grace Paley’s “Jewishness” come through even when she is writing about non-Jewish characters? We will address these issues and others as we explore the literature growing out of the Jewish immigrant experience in America, as well as the literature by Jewish writers more firmly, though still sometimes anxiously, rooted in American soil.

In this course we will engage in a highly contextualized and historicized study of Jewish American literature from the 19th century to today.  We will discover in these texts how inherited Jewish culture and literary imaginings, developed over centuries of interaction between Jewish communities and the “outside world,” get reexamined, questioned, rejected, reimagined, reintegrated, and transformed within the crucible of American experience. The discussions that ensue will also provide a framework for engaging with the creative energies and cultural productivity of more recent immigrant communities in the United States and beyond. Immigration and the experience of immigrant communities continues to be at the forefront of American consciousness, as immigrants work to create new meanings and new narratives for their lives, and as those who immigrated before them provide contested meanings for the impact of immigration on their own narratives. This course, though grounded in Jewish narratives, will therefore provide students with an expanded vocabulary and perspective for engaging in this central and very current debate within the American experience.

Music, as a mode that both creates and reflects culture, provides key insight into political and social systems. Whether we are studying early border ballads by Chelo Silva who challenged gender norms or learning about Bad Bunny’s commitment to revitalizing Puerto Rico’s electrical grid after Hurricane Maria, we will focus on how the musical production impacts broader society. Readings from scholars in Chicana/o/x and Latina/o/x Studies will ground our analysis of music through an intersectional lens. We will unpack the race, class, and gender dynamics that are evident in a particular musical production. Moreover, we will analyze the artist’s positionality (identities in a particular context) to discuss issues of power and resistance. 

The course units are organized in a flexible chronology and by genre. The material ranges from traditional musical styles such as the corrido and bolero to contemporary genres like punk and hip hop. To fully immerse ourselves in Chicana/o/x and Latina/o/x music there are both reading assignments and listening assignments for each class session. When possible, there are also visuals (music videos) that will provide an additional layer for us to analyze. Throughout the semester you will write about individual songs, albums, music videos, and artists by applying course concepts and theories to the work.

"MUS","3301","The Music of Black Americans","Twin Cities","This course examines the variety of ways African and African Americans express social history through music. It will consider the union of African elements and European elements that combined to present a new syncretized African-American product. To do this it is imperative that we explore the diversity of musical ""voices"" found within the African American culture. This diversity can be seen in the struggles to retain African cultural effects and the desire to be eclectic, creative, and contemporary. Such an approach to the study of the place of Black music in American music corresponds with the criteria of Diversity and Social Justice in the United States Liberal Education. The ""multi-layered operation of power, prestige, and privilege"" can be understood through an examination of the music of African Americans, which represents both a Free African voice and an enslaved African voice; the western-trained Black performer/composer and the self-taught performer/composer. It also represents the habits of well-to-do African Americans and the poor African Americans. Students will examine the complexities of the history of African Americans and how this is played out in the development of musical styles and genres. From this, students will then begin to understand how this unique diversity within a community affects those outside of those communities. Such an approach to the study of the place of Black music in American music corresponds with the criteria of Diversity and Social Justice in the United States Liberal Education.

 We will follow elements found in West African culture and music such as ""call and response"" and the ""2nd Line"" as they travel to the ""New World"" and expressed through Spirituals, Symphonies, Gospel Music, Jazz, Rock and Roll, Step Bands and more. Through lectures, readings, discussion, audiovisual examples, and homework assignments student can expect to gain a deeper understanding of the ways music both reflects and influences the social history of all Americans.","3","3","No","1","3","A-F - A-F Grade Basis","-","Every Fall, Spring & Summer"
"POL","3282","Black Political Thought: Conceptions of Freedom","Twin Cities","On January 21, 1964, Ella Baker, one of the most important Black leaders of the Civil Rights Movement stood in front of a large crowd in Hattiesburg, Mississippi and said: ""Even if segregation is gone, we will still need to be free; we will still have to see that everyone has a job. Even if we can all vote, but if people are still hungry, we will not be free. Remember, we are not fighting for the freedom of the Negro alone, but for the freedom of the human spirit, a larger freedom that encompasses all mankind.""

With these words, Baker held before the crowd a political vision that went beyond the immediate goals of social struggle and defined one of the central impulses of Black political thought: to articulate a large and expansive conception of freedom. In this course, our main objective is to enter an intellectual terrain of rich and vibrant debates between African American political thinkers over the meaning of Black freedom.

We will explore questions about 1) the geographical reach of their visions of freedom 2) their strategies for agitating for and achieving freedom 3) their different understandings of the nature of domination and how this informs their conception of freedom and 4) their emphasis on political affect in the struggle for freedom.

Our orientation will be historical and theoretical. To this end, we reconstruct theoretical debates from four important periods of African American history. 1) pre-Civil War debates about the abolition of slavery (1830-1860) 2) Turn of the century debates about racial progress (1880-1910) 3) Civil rights era debates about integration and separatism (1950-1970) and 4) contemporary debates about law enforcement, police killings, mass incarceration, and political disenfranchisement (1990-present).","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Periodic Fall & Spring"

This is a question with deep historical roots in this country, one that is the subject of current policy debates and one that cannot be separated from questions of discrimination and inequality. The over-arching theme of the course is to wrestle with what it means to be an educated citizen in the context of historical struggles to achieve that vision in the face of multiple and inter-related inequalities and competing visions about how to make the American dream a reality in the field of public education. No one political perspective will be offered or favored. No magic powder will be revealed on the last day of the course. The fact is that the underlying issues are really complicated, often seemingly intractable, and very, very political. This course is intended as introduction to education politics and policy in the United States. It will focus on K-12 education, especially in the public system. It is designed for any student who might have an interest in exploring education, public policy, or American government. Topics will include equality of educational opportunity, educating democratic citizens, school finance, the role of political institutions in making educational policy, and efforts to reform and remake American education, including charter schools, private school vouchers, and standardized testing. By the end of the course, students should have a basic understanding of the provision of public education in the United States, including the ways in which education is governed and the institutions involved in that governance. Students should be able to critically reflect on the degree to which American education fulfills the sometimes-competing goals Americans have for their schools. This course fulfills the Social Sciences Core of the University liberal education requirements.

To explore these topics, the field turns to key texts, as well as to political and social events and other media (film, historical documents, etc.). Through this course, students will also be introduced to different interpretive approaches, ranging from democratic theory, feminist, queer and critical race theories, as well as ethics and moral philosophy. Organized around the politics of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, the course will pursue a range of questions about democratic legitimation, the exclusion of historically marginalized communities, systematic inequalities of different kinds, as well as ideals of democracy and justice. It will range from theoretical inquiry to practical questions of implementing different political projects.

"POL","4771","Race and Politics in America: Making Sense of Racial Attitudes in the United States","Twin Cities","Race continues to be one of the defining fault lines in American politics. Most obviously, the existence of racial inequality has enormous consequences for any given individual's social and economic standing. However, it also has had an enormous impact on the pattern of attitudes and beliefs which have served as the backdrop for many of society's most pressing political debates and conflicts. 

The purpose of this course is to provide students with an introduction to how political scientists have studied racial attitudes and the larger problem of inter-ethnic conflict in American society. We will begin with a look at the historical circumstances which have given rise to the major research questions in the area. From there, we'll look at the major research perspectives in the area, and see how well they actually explain public opinion on matters of race. In doing so, we'll also get a look at some of the major controversies in this area of study, particularly the issues of whether the ""old-fashioned racism"" of the pre-civil-rights era has been replaced by new forms of racism; and the degree to which debates over policy matters with no apparent link to race - such as crime and social welfare - may actually have a lot to do with racial attitudes. Finally, we will conclude by taking an informed look at racial attitudes in recent American history, focusing on how racial attitudes and their political consequences of have changed - and not changed - over the course of the Obama presidency and the tumultuous 2016 election.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Periodic Fall"

We will discover in these texts how inherited Jewish culture and literary imaginings, developed over centuries of interaction between Jewish communities and the “outside world,” get reexamined, questioned, rejected, reimagined, reintegrated, and transformed within the crucible of American experience. The discussions that ensue will also provide a framework for engaging with the creative energies and cultural productivity of more recent immigrant communities in the United States and beyond. Immigration and the experience of immigrant communities continues to be at the forefront of American consciousness, as immigrants work to create new meanings and new narratives for their lives, and as those who immigrated before them provide contested meanings for the impact of immigration on their own narratives. This course, though grounded in Jewish narratives, will therefore provide students with an expanded vocabulary and perspective for engaging in this central and very current debate within the American experience.

This course is designed to examine the pervasive and significant relationships between the social constructions of and within sport and physical activity to contemporary social institutions such as politics, religion, economics, education, and mass media. Students are introduced to a broad perspective of social issues related to sport and physical activity and will critically explore how specific social categories (e.g., race, ethnicity, age, physical abilities, social class, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, and religion) intersect to influence individuals’ participation and experiences within sport and physical activity contexts. In short, students will explore the ""deeper game"" through which sport and physical activities become an integral part of the social, cultural, and global worlds in which we live.","3","3","No","1","3","A-F - A-F Grade Basis","-","Every Fall & Spring"

While the death of George Floyd galvanized peoples worldwide to speak out against discrimination and inequality, well before his death studies suggested that ethnic and racial discrimination and conflict re-occur on an ongoing basis. From the events of the Holocaust - to the genocide against the Rohingya in Myanmar - to the torture of Uighurs in China - to the Atlantic slave trade - we explore how identities are formed - and thereafter - how those same identities are deployed - to exclude and marginalize - with targeted precision. Across the world, we examine how racial bias and racial animus contribute to slavery, torture, mass displacement, economic destitution, and genocide.

"YOST","1366","Stories of Resistance & Change: Youth, Race, Power & Privilege in the U.S.","Twin Cities","This course imagines literature as an opportunity to complement other understandings of youth, and to help those who work with children and adolescents to better understand their lived experiences. We will read classic and contemporary literary texts that respond to the needs, wants, and existential questions that surround young people’s lives, and makes them visible to learners in the class who want to better understand children and adolescents in diverse settings across the United States. Youth Studies at the University of Minnesota, prepares students to work towards understanding and helping to improve the everyday lives of diverse youth. By being in this class, reading our course texts carefully, and by engaging in learning activities with classmates, students have the chance to take away new understandings from powerful stories about youth. In fact, the texts in this course contain important descriptions of how oppression looks and feels to young people as they navigate institutions and see the impacts of structural inequality on themselves, communities, families, and friends. The young people in these texts show tremendous agency, and show meaningful examples of resistance on large and small scales. We will work together with course texts about how young people challenge and are challenged by their surroundings, and take away new meanings about how young people have promoted social justice and change. 

Learning activities in this class will include reading, writing, quizzes and exams and a course project. In class learning activities include discussion, presentations, activities, and a high level of participation is expected. Why literature? Literature can be thought of as one way of knowing about the daily lives of youth. Because literature offers a rich detailed framework of meaning showing the diverse contexts of lives of children, teenagers and young adults, youth workers can use the tools of literature to make youth work meanings from literature in which young people are primary to the text. Literature can make up a new lens through which learners can understand the daily and everyday lives of youth, and can complement the important social science lenses you may already bring to the class. Students are encouraged to develop a new set of questions about youth as they use the formal tools of literature to read literary texts that represent a range of styles, formats, themes, and choices. Diversity and Social Justice Literature that centers on young people from multicultural settings offers an opportunity to think about what it is that students already know about youth from diverse backgrounds, and to question whether their understanding is correct or if there are gaps in knowledge. In other words, a course goal will be to identify epistemological gaps between what we think we know about youth, race, gender, and power and privilege, and how that is confirmed and/or made more complicated by a larger body of knowledge about social constructions of power and privilege. This course calls on our literary texts to challenge and deconstruct dominant narratives about youth and their communities. Learners in this course enter into an ongoing conversation about what social justice for youth means in the context of unequal distribution of power and constructions of privilege and oppression.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Fall & Spring"
"YOST","2101","Urban Youth and Youth Issues","Twin Cities","This course explores issues faced by youth, especially those who live in or are characterized by our understanding of urban areas. We might begin by asking questions like “why aren’t youth in racially segregated and economically privileged urban areas of Minneapolis labeled “urban”, while poor immigrant youth in the suburban housing projects of Paris are,” “how did city planners and urban housing policy act to segregate and problematize some geographies and people” or “how are urban communities policed and what are the consequences of this policing”?

We will critically examine what the term “urban youth” means, how it has evolved over time and place and its use as a code word with implicit association and within this context how urban youth have been studied, problematized and worked with. Using a critical Youth Studies framework, which engages with the role of historical, social, cultural, geographical and political contexts, we seek to understand how each of these axes of power-relations influence the opportunities and struggles of young people, their interaction with institutions and the construction of their identities in particular places. We then seek to rethink new directions in research and practice and understand what this means for youth as citizens.","4","4","No","1","4","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Fall & Spring"
"YOST","3001","Introduction to History & Philosophy of Youthwork","Twin Cities","This course exposes students to a depth of perspectives on young people and youth work. Exploring various historic and philosophical origins of “normal” childhood, we unveil the way our modern understandings of child, youth, and adolescent draw upon a rich history of sexist, colonialist, and racist science. To do so we explore Indigenous, early European, Middle-Class, and W.E.I.R.D. (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic) notions of childhood. We explore how these ideas are operationalized into practices on youth/youth work. We explore how contemporary organizations of American youth work and youth development, then took up and applied these ideas thus naturalizing modern norms and expectations of child and youth. This course covers the philosophical and historical foundations of youth work in a critical and interactive way through a review of youth, youth work, and youth organizations set in the context of the past 500 years. 

The course is designed to encourage students to examine their familial histories, timelines, and geographies and through collaborative and interactive learning, begin to explore how these histories, combined with others, helped to shape the ways that we think about youth and how this thinking collectively shapes youth policy, practice, and the institutions within which we meet and work with young people. All of this with the goal of becoming more effective and thoughtful when working with young people in youth-work settings. Whether you choose to work in youth-work settings or in other human service organization or agency, developing a sense of cultural humility and skills to understand historical data, philosophical frames, and current practices will be critical to your success in professional arenas.
