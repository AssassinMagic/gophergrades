"AFRO","3578","Contemporary Sub-Saharan African Popular Art Forms","Twin Cities","This course explores popular art practices and representations – mediated through the lens of television, radio, popular cinema, sequential art, and the internet – as the everyday expressions of modern African identities. As sites where the tensions, frictions, collisions and notably, the productive creativities of the local and the global are circulated, negotiated and contested, African popular cultures provide insights into a unique and increasingly crucial facet of contemporary African artistic practice as critical intervention. The course is designed on the premise that Africans of all social strata and lifestyles are strategic and deliberate consumers of popular cultural forms, generated within local cultures as signifiers of larger social, political, and economic processes. In light of prevailing studies which sometimes end up naively celebrating agency and resistance, AFRO 3578 underscores the role of popular cultures as public/private sites of power's ideological and material (re-) production, contestation, or transformation. It considers creative practices as sites of both resistance and accommodation; of creative adaptation, innovation, and resilience. Through our discussion of communication technologies and their role in transmitting artistic and political ideas beyond the confines of dominant discourses and established institutions, we will evaluate the interface of technology and sociocultural shifts.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Periodic Fall & Spring"

This course takes a distinctly geographic approach to these questions, one that is interested in how socio-cultural, political-economic, and biophysical forces intersect in the shaping of America as a place. In this class, we will explore the kind of social and technological innovations and transformations that have made the American present. We will look at how the decisions of the past have shaped both the possibilities and problems of the present in order to help us grapple with the complexities of building the kinds of futures we want to live in. Rather than approaching this as an inevitable story of triumphant progress, we will pay attention to the erasures, exploitation, and violence that were part of these transformations. It is only through grappling with these complexities that we can work towards a future that works.

This course is designed for any student who is interested in making sense of the country we live in and feels invested in its future. Through the use of case studies, we will explore some of the essential issues facing modern America including immigration and sense of place, agriculture, and water in the Great Plains and the American West, and the intertwined future of American urbanism and the automobile industry as well as a few others. Students can expect to build skills in integrative thinking as they explore problems at the intersection of a variety of human and natural systems as well as an appreciation for how complexity shapes the production of and solution for contemporary socio-environmental problems.

"MILI","3589","Medical Technology and Society","Twin Cities","Course Description
Innovations in medical technologies are one of the leading areas of economic growth in the world. Whether new technologies take the form of pharmaceutical, medical device, biotechnology, information technology of some combination of these innovations, the opportunities for both private enterprise and social welfare are substantial. However, these innovations are not without cost, and require reimbursement from either a privately or publicly financed health care delivery system. Thus, the demand for the evaluation of new medical technologies continues to grow as new treatments are developed and health care costs continue to rise. This course aims to provide knowledge of the skills, data, and methodology required to critically evaluate new medical technologies from a social perspective as well as from a business perspective in order to meet financial investment and regulatory compliance objectives. The course will provide an introduction to the analytic tool kit needed to critically evaluate new medical technologies including:
1.	Understanding regulatory pathways such as the FDA approval
2.	Understanding the U.S. payment policy & reimbursement for medical technology
3.	Assessing unmet needs and the relevant market for the technology
4.	Evaluating the social and economic value to convince payers to cover and reimburse the technology
5.	Recognizing provider, healthcare organization and market-level factors that influence adoption of new medical technologies. 

Throughout the course, students will work on team-based hands-on exercises that will provide them gain further understanding of the impact of medical technology from the perspectives of an innovator, a regulator, a payer, a public entity, and consumers of the medical technology including physicians, hospitals, health systems and patients.","3","3","No","1","3","AFV - A-F or Audit","-","Every Spring"
"MUS","1916","All About Music: Its Meaning, Reality, Communication, and Embodiment","Twin Cities","The great philosopher of life Friedrich Nietzsche rightly claims that without music, life would be a mistake. This does not mean that life is automatically perfect with music. This seminar deals with exactly this problem: What is music doing to us? Why do we listen to it? And how? What is its meaning in our lives, why does it matter, which realities does it touch, how can it be communicated? In what way is it distributed between intellect and emotions? And why do we go to concerts, since electronic media and the internet provide such easy access? The answers will be approached via intensive listening to all kinds of music from different cultures and epochs as well as through critical, very open discussions with the students. The instructor is highly sensitive to non-authoritarian music cultures, so he may provide a thoroughly dynamic and flexible access to music.","3","3","No","1","3","A-F - A-F Grade Basis","001475","Periodic Fall & Spring"
