"BA","2551","Business Statistics in R","Twin Cities","The purpose of the course is to develop skills for improving data-driven decision-making using statistical techniques in the powerful statistical software environment R. As an introductory statistics course, the content will include three main areas of statistics: Descriptive Statistics, Statistical Inference, and Analysis of Relationships with Scatterplots, Correlation and Linear Regression. Developing statistical literacy is increasingly important in understanding data and engaging in the complex business world. BA 2551 focuses on statistical reasoning and how to implement statistical methods in a business context using R. Topics include (but are not limited to) descriptive statistics, statistical inference, variability, sampling, distributions, correlation analysis, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, graphical summaries of data, and introduction to linear regression. Through weekly in-class lab sessions and critical thinking assignments related to statistics in business, the course will train students to become informed consumers of numerical information and provide foundational skills in R to compute statistical procedures in future courses. We use existing packages in R as a tool to enable us to solve business problems that can leverage mathematical and statistical thinking.

"CEGE","1201","Emerging Technologies in Transportation: Automated and Electric Vehicles","Twin Cities","Emerging battery and computer technologies are revolutionizing our daily transportation.
Vehicle automation has the potential to reduce congestion, create new methods of traffic control, and change our travel patterns. 29% of United States greenhouse gas emissions come from transportation, and electric vehicles could help reduce the environmental impacts. This course presents an introductory exploration into automated and electric vehicle technologies from a transportation systems perspective. As you study emerging technologies, you will also get exposed to the engineering methods used to design current transportation systems.

"EPSY","1261","Understanding Data Stories through Visualization & Computing","Twin Cities","Academics and researchers have long used data & visualization to support and illuminate particular narratives in their scholarship. Today, data visualizations are found not only in the pages of academic journals; many non-academics, including journalists and activists, use increasingly complex data visualizations and statistical summaries to convey salient information and storylines. This course will help students build on their statistical thinking and understanding learned in high school to think critically about the use of summaries and visualization and their role in the data narrative. It will also cover the use of computational tools and methods for creating data summaries and visualization that facilitate seeing patterns and relationships in data, and producing better narrative through communicating with data. Students will learn course material through in-class activities and projects conducted in cooperative learning groups and through assignments requiring the application of concepts and technology presented in class to additional real-world examples of data visualization.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Fall & Spring"

The first part of the class covers how to formulate a theory (a possible answer to a question), specify testable hypotheses (what you would see if the theory is correct or incorrect), and set up a research design to test those hypotheses. In the second part of the class, we cover quantitative data analysis, beginning from preliminary statistical analysis to multivariate linear regression. There is no mathematical or statistical background required for this course. By the end of the class, students should be able to ask and answer political questions using quantitative data and fluently evaluate statistical analyses of political phenomena in the media and many academic articles.","4","4","No","1","4","AFV - A-F or Audit","-","Every Fall & Spring"
"POL","4087","Thinking Strategically About Politics","Twin Cities","The purpose of this class is threefold. First is to introduce students to the use and value of formal models of strategic interaction (game theoretic models) in political science. Second is to impart some basic tools of such modeling to students. And third is to examine the contribution of theoretical models to several common game theoretic problems that appear across a variety of different political applications.

In keeping with these three goals, the course is divided into three sections. The first session will be devoted to such questions as, what is a theoretical model?  What are rational choice and game theory? 

The next portion of the class will introduce students to the basic tools employed in game theoretic analysis. The readings will illustrate the use of the tools introduced in class. Five problem sets will be administered, requiring students to make use of these tools.  

The final portion of the class will examine types of game theoretic problems that appear in a variety of political settings. These include retrospective voting and accountability, prospective voting and the role of the median voter, problems of coordination and the role of information, problems of collective action and the problem of free riding, and problems of credible commitment.
