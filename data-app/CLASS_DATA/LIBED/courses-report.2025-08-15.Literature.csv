"AMES","1836","Modern Middle Eastern Literature","Twin Cities","This course introduces students to the diversity of contemporary Middle Eastern cultures, identities, and histories through readings in modern literature. Reading novels, stories, poetry, and memoirs translated from Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, and Turkish, we will follow a number of key concerns shaping Middle Eastern cultural production: legacies of colonialism and the manner they shaped the relationship between classical and modern literary forms, the ethical and aesthetic challenges of bearing testimony to violence, and the manner literature reflects and subverts racial hierarchies, ethnic divisions, and gender dynamics. These themes will be debated in a range of spaces and contexts: the desert, the city, and the ocean as quintessential environments in times of great social and ecological upheavals; migration flows and refugee identities; the alternating banality and grotesqueness of war; and the formation of intimate, personal relationships.

pre-Islamic era till the present time used their verse as a tool to affirm the structure of their society, or to
struggle with it? What roles did Arabic poetry play at the Abbasid imperial courts? How does Arabic

This course traces the trope of the jinni in Arabic literature: from the place of jinn in the Quran and Islamic tradition, through their role in the composition of the greatest poetry, to their reincarnation in modern works of literature. Following a survey of classic texts and contexts, we will ask why modern authors summon demons and resurrect ghosts, and what political and cultural work these unruly beings are called to perform. More specifically, we will explore the manner in which jinn are latched onto modern debates on personal and collective trauma, memory, madness, relations between East and West (or North and South), political and state violence, gender relations and hierarchies, and virtual realities.","3","3","No","1","3","A-F - A-F Grade Basis","-","Periodic Fall & Spring"

The class centers on the manner in which Hebrew literature has envisioned the Middle East or “the Orient,” reflecting, manipulating, or challenging orientalist paradigms. The first part of the course focuses on Hebrew literature written by Eastern European writers, their fantasies of the East as well as their engagements with orientalist or anti-Semite prejudices. The second part examines Hebrew literature’s attempts to “nativize” in Palestine. Finally, we will read a series of texts by Ashkenazi, Mizrahi, and Palestinian Israeli writers that complicate any attempt to position Hebrew within an Orient/Occident dichotomy. No prior familiarity with Hebrew literature is necessary. All texts will be read in English.","3","3","No","1","3","A-F - A-F Grade Basis","-","Periodic Fall & Spring"

"CNRC","1201","The Bible: Context and Interpretation, World of the Hebrew Bible.","Twin Cities","The Hebrew Bible and Old Testament are literary collections that modern Jewish and Christian traditions maintain as important, but these collections were initially produced by ancient Israelite scribes who composed and/or compiled the biblical texts at particular time periods in the ancient Near East. This course will introduce the academic study of biblical texts, which demands critical analysis of the literature and an openness to reading the literature from the perspective of ancient Israelite writers (who lived in a world far different from today). The course will spend considerable time on the literary (and scribal) composition of biblical prose texts; time will also be spent on the historical circumstances of biblical prophets and other writers of the biblical texts. This course will only address the ancient setting of the biblical texts and not re-interpretations in Jewish or Christian traditions. Given the scope of the course, modern interpretations of the biblical literature will not be discussed; we will only focus on this literature in its ancient setting.

Appearing in book titles, such as Parable of the Sower by Octavia E. Butler or serving as a foundation for societal structures in works like The Handmaid’s Tale by Margaret Atwood. Characters in the dystopian novels often parallel biblical figures, while allusions, biblical names, themes, and plotlines are also common. Dystopian literature's primary function is to invite critical reflection of existing social conditions and political systems, and in this course we will take part in these discussions.

"CSCL","3117","Concepts of Literary Study","Twin Cities","This course begins by asking what this strange thing we call literature is, this six-thousand year old form of writing that brings into existence, each time a work is read, a world that did not previously exist. Sometimes that world is one in which we long to live, sometimes it is dark and foreboding, all death and despair; sometimes we seek it out as an escape from our daily lives, sometimes we enter it to be able to better understand those same lives, to come back to them refreshed, not just emotionally but intellectually -- for if literature does involve an immersion in the not-actually-existent, a departure from the everyday world, it does so by engaging us from within the world and in such a way that it is able to recast our everyday world and make us think it in new ways. And literature does all this with that most everyday of things, language. By attending to the ways authors and scholars mobilise language’s expressive, analytic and conceptual resources, with this course we shall learn various methods of critically appreciating and engaging complex literature, while gaining insight into how the practices of literary criticism and theory relate to, and help us understand, the world in which we live, how language shapes and forms that world and literature’s unique place and role in that world and its forming.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Fall & Spring"
"CSCL","3122","Movements and Manifestos","Twin Cities","Movements that emerge when a group of writers, filmmakers, artists, composers,
or musicians puts forth a new definition of literature, film, art, or music—and sets in motion new relations
(aesthetic and social) of word, image, sound. Manifestos—statements of position—that articulate or
counter such definitions. Movements created by scholars or critics after the fact. Focuses on one or two

"CSCL","3141","Classics of World Literature","Twin Cities","This will be an introduction to the concept of world literature – that is, literature from the Arab, Asian, African, Latin American and Oceanic worlds, not only the English-speaking countries of England and its former colonies.   And it will introduce students to some of the basic methods of comparative literary study such as close reading, genre analysis, etymology, stylistics, and translation.   We will discuss classic problems confronted within comparative literature such as collective authorship, the spirit of a people, the historical reconstruction of the past through the study of language, comparative cultural value, and the effects on language and learning prompted by technology (in the form, for example, of the “digital humanities”).   We will ask how comparative literature differs from other forms of literary study, but most of all concentrate on the low-tech (but not anti-technological) reading of literary texts – the student alone with a book in their hand -- while mastering as one’s own a handful of the enduring classics of world literature – books that have influenced many generations of thinkers and writers but that, oddly, are not typically covered in any college curriculum: not in English classes, humanities introductions, or general knowledge courses.   Our focus will be on books that happen both to be central to Western and world culture as part of the inheritance of its educated citizens, but also that happen to be lost at the same time, known about rather than known, invoked but not studied, quoted from but not generally understood.   We will be addressing books, in other words, that deeply inspired, but also shaped the thinking of many of the scientists, artists, and scholars of the past, and which were once common knowledge – the expected points of departure for all educated men and women.   In our own day, their influence has hardly waned – although not in their original form.  Modern film and television industries, for instance, rely heavily on their stories, even as philosophers and theologians cannot express themselves without drawing on their characters, languages, and plots.  Even the basic elements of advertising would be unthinkable without being able to draw on their repertoire of common stories, mythological settings, and cast of heroes.  In an age of radical departures and brave new worlds, we are interested here in invaluable traditions, which have not lost their relevance.

In this course, we will begin with the three books currently banned most frequently in the US. While the class will touch on the long international history of book banning, in this course you will learn primarily about the recent history of book banning in the US.

"ENGL","1005","Reading Poetry","Twin Cities","Poems say interesting things in small spaces. How do they do it? The famous American poet Emily Dickinson wrote, “If I feel physically as if the top of my head were taken off, I know that is poetry.” While Dickinson isn’t describing poems that literally saw through her skull, she is describing the odd and wondrous ways in which poems affect us. While poems are literary texts, they are musical, visual, and, most often, short. White, brown, and black folks from all walks of life read and write them. Expect to read poems from a variety of perspectives and time periods that all say interesting things in their own, individual ways.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Spring"

Are queer books and authors inherently indecent throughout literary history? Will they become more immoral or more accepted in our future? Today, society’s judgments and punishments begin online.

In this class you will consider your relationship to other species, as well as places and habitats, through analysis of historical and contemporary texts by Black, Brown, Indigenous and white artists and thinkers, some of whom also draw upon queer perspectives. Throughout the course you will practice literary language that helps you advocate for greater awareness of nonhuman life as well as for action and change. Along the way your instructor will help you understand literature as an essential and hopeful tool that people use to reshape our own cultures and preserve biodiversity in a complex future. Because environmental literature is part of the emerging field of the environmental humanities, texts vary and could include: climate fiction, ecocinema, ecopoetics, environmental nonfiction, and other emerging forms and genres.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Fall & Spring"
"ENGL","1031","Introduction to the Short Story","Twin Cities","English literature boasts some of the most powerful, beautifully crafted short stories in world literature. In this class, we will use the short story as a path for understanding the craft of writing: how writers use language to present a vividly imagined world in a short number of pages. We will also examine the importance of genre: how, for example, a detective short story differs from a slice of life story. This is a lecture course, but will involve substantial student discussion.

"ENGL","1051","Progress & Madness: Literature, Science & Technology","Twin Cities","This introductory, Liberal Education course explores the conflicts and conversations that occur at the frontiers of scientific thinking and technological innovation by examining select literary and cinematic texts from a variety of historical moments and points of view. We will consider the ambivalence and anxiety that attend progress via topics such as electricity, telegraphy, photography, the railroad, the cinema, Fordism, the atomic bomb, genetic engineering, and the Internet. We will also track the archetype of the mad scientist, whose dangerous knowledge and often-fatal hubris typically turn a tale ""cautionary."" Students engage in detailed analysis of and reflection on works of literature and film that address both historical and contemporary developments in science and technology. The course introduces students to a range of technologies that have had a measurable impact on contemporary society. Class discussion uses the representation of these innovations as case studies in how technologies develop through the application of individual and collective effort, as well as how society adopts or rejects these technologies. By considering a variety of points of view on these developments, students are exposed to multiple perspectives through which a technology can be understood, and they develop skills in evaluating conflicting views that provide a framework with which to evaluate new technology in the future.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Fall"
"ENGL","1172","The Story of King Arthur","Twin Cities","Of all the stories familiar to the western world, few have exerted a greater influence on literary, pictorial, and musical productions than the legend of King Arthur and his Round Table. Although thousands of years have passed since the earliest versions of the story appeared, creative artists and their audiences continue to be fascinated by stories about Arthur, Merlin, Lancelot, Guinevere, Gawain, and Tristan. In this course, we will study adaptations of the legend in order to understand how literary writers and their readers remade the story to fit specific, historical circumstances. The course will pay particular attention to two related aspects of the legend. The first is the way that stories about Arthur emphasize the importance of personal integrity as a shaping force of history. The second is the relationship between personal responsibility and communal or civic order. We will see how these ideas are reshaped by writers in various times and places (ranging from early medieval Wales and England to twenty-first-century America). We will think comparatively about these times and places by paying close attention to the literary traditions and forms that are employed by writers who remake the story of Arthur.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Spring"

As the two function as rival, unreal genres under the larger heading of fantastika, they lead us to consider dual worlds. Through reading diverse literary texts, sometimes including films adapted from the literature, students will explore unreal characters, cultures, ecologies, genders, languages, races, politics, settings, and technologies. By depicting invented worlds that differ in some way from the real world, works of fantastika automatically invite us to compare the real and unreal worlds and to scrutinize the differences between the two.

Unlike other works of literature, they are more likely to contain art. What role do the illustrations and art play a role in telling the story? You will read contemporary and historical works with a focus on diversity regarding authors, themes, and readership.

"ENGL","3028","Paranoia and Pleasure: Contemporary American Spy Novels","Twin Cities","Spy fiction emerged in Britain and the United States during the early 20th century.  Since then, it proliferated thematic sub-genres such as Tom Clancy’s techno-thrillers, Vince Flynn’s CIA-trained assassin, James Rollins’ science disaster group, David Baldacci’s eccentric Camel Club, and Daniel Silva’s globe-trotting Israeli spy Gabriel Allon.  Spy Fi is concerned with threats to the state--Nazis, Russians, rogue states, terrorist masterminds, and moles here at home.  In contrast to British Spy Fi, famously represented by James Bond, the MI6 agent who plied his trade in sophisticated or exotic settings, American novels tend to feature cowboy protagonists with military or sports backgrounds and a penchant for spectacular violence.  In this course, we will read novels and analyze the development of sub-genres, protagonists, plots, settings, and language; the shifting roles of female characters; the paranoiac ideologies that hover beneath the narratives or pop to the surface; and the target audiences and sales.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Periodic Fall & Spring"

We will examine some of the ways that musical and literary texts can change, subvert, or augment each other by applying critical and literary theories to intertextual readings. Among the subjects we may discuss are how authors use music in their work, both structurally and topically; how musicians use literature, both as lyric and as subject matter; and how members of each group engage the artistic assumptions of the other.  Students will gain a greater appreciation of the varied forms of creative expression and an increased understanding of how they influence each other through close reading and listening, discussions, reflective writing, and presentations.

"ENGL","3072","Witchcraft, Possession, Magic: Concepts in the Atlantic Supernatural, 1500-1800","Twin Cities","Salem is what typically comes to mind when we think of witchcraft, and our class will indeed focus on the 1692 trials and their aftermath. But we will also range more broadly, exploring witchcraft in the early Atlantic world by paying special attention to the roles played by magic and possession. A fundamental aspect of this course, moreover, is its distinction as a literary one. This is not a class about how witchcraft, possession, and magic “change over time” but a class about their representations. From the beginning, we will be deeply attentive to the fact that each and every “evidence” of witchcraft, possession, or magic is an act of representation in the first place. As literary historians, we will move from Europe to the Americas, looking at how invocations and accusations of witchcraft traveled between the 16th and late-18th centuries. More importantly, as literary critics we will trace and examine depictions of witchcraft and the idea of the witch across four interrelated socio-historical contexts: the Protestant Reformation in 16th-century Europe; slave medicine and obeah in the Caribbean; possession and the “invisible world” in Puritan Massachusetts; and revivalism in 18th-century New England. By the end of this course, you will be able to: interpret literary texts and understand the literary aspects of historical documents; place literature in relation to its historical and cultural contexts; locate and evaluate relevant scholarship and cultural commentary; and formulate and communicate focused and stylistically appropriate that supports its claims with textual evidence, especially through close and critical reading.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Spring"
"ENGL","3091","The Literature and Film of Baseball","Twin Cities","Baseball is the national pastime, often evoked with Mom and apple pie in a trinity of American-ness. How do Americans represent something they see as so quintessentially themselves? In this class, we will look at the variety and complexity of answers given to that question, from sunny nostalgia, to valorization of the individual, valorization of the team, depictions of the dark side of the American dream, critiques of racial relations, and an approach that strives to eliminate both the poetry and the hand-wringing with a long hard look at numbers and facts. In this journey, we will study and participate in a number of ways that literature teaches us to understand society and ourselves. We will examine the idea of American pastoral and anti-pastoral. We will use the great variety of ways to write about baseball as a platform to consider how we come to know and believe. Throughout the course, we will examine the way baseball writing treats race and gender. We will also look at excerpts of films made from some of the texts. Comparing the films to the literature allows us to discuss what representations of America seem more palatable to producers aiming for a larger audience than literature usually reaches and to highlight ways writing makes arguments that films cannot.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Spring"

"ENGL","3101","Knights and Pilgrims in Medieval Literature","Twin Cities","Medieval writers and readers were fascinated by stories about knights and about pilgrims.  In this course, we study some of the best-known and most compelling narratives and poems from the Middle Ages.  Although written hundreds of years ago, these literary works speak to us of the human desire to strive for meaning and excellence, to work toward shared ideas of community, and to explore worlds beyond the sometimes narrow confines of home.

Knights and pilgrims appear as central figures in a wide range of literary works.  Some of the texts are humorous, like Chaucer's Canterbury Tales in which pilgrims, from social classes ranging from knights to tradespeople, travel together and tell stories.  Some are exciting and emotional, like Malory's retelling of stories about King Arthur and his knights.  Others provide us with explorations of longing for change:  in these works people search for new kinds of social and spiritual life such as Margery Kempe's autobiographical account of her experiences as a pilgrim to Rome and the Holy Land.  Still others, such as Langland's Piers Plowman, which incorporates pilgrimage and chivalric quest, critique and explode static ideas about social problems such as poverty and hunger.  Some draw our attention to the dangers and turmoil involved in love and relationships, such as Marie de France's courtly, aristocratic lays:  Marie's knights and ladies take up the search for love and meaning.  Some, finally, invite us to imagine ourselves in mysterious otherworlds, such as Mandeville's Travels and Sir Orfeo, both of which focus on travel and self knowledge.  These exciting and challenging works continue to speak to us about the quest to pursue ideals and to change the world and ourselves.

"ENGL","3151","British Romantic Literature and Culture","Twin Cities","In British Romantic Literature and Culture, students read poetry and prose written during the Romantic Period (1780-1832). Romantic authors permanently changed the way literature treats numerous subjects: nature, the imagination, revolution, war and politics, the role of the poet, the depiction of common life and language, and the representation of personal experience, to name a few. This was a period of great stylistic innovation, as authors experimented with the use of symbolism and the adaptation of classical mythology and explored medieval/gothic images and themes. Possible authors to be studied in this course include Jane Austen, Anna Letitia Barbauld, William Blake, Lord Byron, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Felicia Hemans, John Keats, Mary Shelley, Percy Shelley, Charlotte Smith, Mary Wollstonecraft, William Wordsworth.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Fall Odd Year"
"ENGL","3161","Victorian Literatures and Cultures","Twin Cities","Why is the twenty-first century so obsessed with the nineteenth?  From steampunk to political rhetoric, from movies to sex, writers and artists look back to the Victorian era for inspiration and challenge.  One reason might be that Britain was the first country to experience the full effects of industrialized capitalism, with the opportunities and misery that it created.  It also developed one of the largest empires in history, an empire whose legacy continues to shape global politics in good and bad ways.  For all these reasons, understanding the Victorians is key to understanding ourselves.

Women writers like Charlotte Bronte and George Eliot have always been at the center of Victorian studies, so the history and politics of gender are vital to Victorian literature.  Class likewise remains inescapable in Victorian fiction with its sharp sense of a world divided into haves and have nots; depictions of the catastrophic effects of the factory system on the urban poor pervade Victorian literature and challenge readers to ponder how, and if, reading might lead to political action.  Race has increasingly reshaped understandings of the literature of the period; although Britain abolished slavery in 1833-34, the period saw both a heightening of racist rhetoric and representation and the growth of a market for works by writers of color from the colonies, including Mary Seacole, J. J. Thomas, and Toru Dutt.  

Digital tools have made the present moment an exciting one in which to study this literature because so much information is now available:  Victorian writing has become hyperaccessible for those with access to computers.  For this class, this accessibility means that students have the opportunity not just to learn exiting knowledge about the period but to discover new truths about it for themselves.  This course aims to empower students to find their own paths to understanding and representing the Victorians as a way of revising how they see their present.

Instapoets and Tik Tok poets are bringing poems to everyone, including people with no experience reading and analyzing poetry. Due to the compressed brevity of a poem, it’s an art form that excels in a digital, textual age. In Living Poets, you will read many different poetic works, including those by Asian American and Pacific Islander, Black, Brown, Indigenous, female-identified and queer poets who are very much alive, here in the Twin Cities and across the USA as well as the world. Unlike poems from centuries ago, these poems use contemporary language and are grounded in more recent events and experiences—contexts that make these poems easier to enter as readers.  Using contemporary culture as a comfortable entry point to the timeless subject of poetry, you will consider the literary histories and movements that precede these poems, such as Confessionalism, as well as forms that poets reinvent, such as the sonnet.

"ENGL","3741","Literacy and American Cultural Diversity","Twin Cities","Literacy and American Cultural Diversity combines academic study with experiential learning in order to collectively build more engaged, more complex understandings of literacy, educational institutions, counter-institutional literacy programs, the grassroots and nonprofit sectors, and the struggles of a multicultural civil society in a putative democracy.  We will ground our inquiry in government studies, as well as sociological, historical, and educational writings. Standard literature, such as a memoir, a selection of poems, some short fiction, and a novel will further open up our twin themes of literacy and multiculturalism – as will less “official” literature, such as manifestos and the transcribed stories of immigrants, refugees, and other marginalized communities.

We begin with the basic understanding of literacy as reading and writing, noting that, according to the National Survey of Adult Literacy, 46% of Americans scored in the lowest two levels of a five-tiered literacy test. What does this mean? Are such tests accurate or otherwise helpful?   What about your basic literacy? As you read this syllabus, you’re making use of basic abilities that you’ve likely been practicing most of your life through formal schooling, daily routines, recreational pursuits, and work-related duties. But there’s more. On another level, you bring knowledge to your reading (some conscious, some unconscious), and the ideological field supplies you with assumptions about the role of literacy in your development, the role of a university course in your plans for your personal and professional life, and your position in a society that constantly raises the standards of literacy, basing success on your ability to keep up. Thus the very word “literacy” calls into play many beliefs we have about our class system, our cultural life, economic and political structures, and educational institutions. Accordingly, our analysis will move beyond basic “reading and writing” to wider concepts of literacy in our society, investigating issues that have much to do with our role as public citizens involved in shaping our individual and collective future.  In tandem with our “classroom” work, our service-learning work in the community (see Your Practicum as Literacy Workers, below) will enable us to develop more “tangible” understandings of the ways that literacy, educational theories, practices, and the construction of knowledge and skills through educational policies provide a “map” of the shifting socioeconomic, cultural, and political terrains of the U.S., the institutional inequities that result from these arrangements, as well as the justice work needed to transform those inequities.","4","4","No","1","4","OPN - Student Option No Audit","-","Every Fall & Spring"

In this course, we will study troubadour songs, short tales, romances, and letters composed in twelfth-century France and Anglo-Norman England. We will examine their historical context: the patronage of Eleanor of Aquitaine and her family, the broader context of medieval court life, and the erudite circles that formed during the rise of the Parisian schools. Because what people say is determined by the language, motifs, and forms that they have available to them, we will discuss the transmission of ideas about love and the interpretation of exemplary figures (Tristan and Iseut, Lancelot and Guinevere). We will also consider the literary form of these texts in relation to their meaning. But at the heart of our inquiry will be the notion of the self. How did ""speaking of love"" allow medieval writers to cultivate their own subjectivity or individuality?

Texts will include troubadour songs, the Lais of Marie de France, the romances of Tristan and Iseut by Thomas of England and Béroul, Chrétien de Troyes's Arthurian romances, and the letters of Abelard and Heloise. We will also study a film about Eleanor of Aquitaine and her family (The Lion in Winter, 1968) and a contemporary opera about a troubadour and his lady, Kaija Saariaho's L'Amour de loin (2000).

"HSEM","3243H","The Evolution of Care & Belonging in the United Kingdom","Twin Cities","This Honors Seminar comprises both a course taught here at the University of Minnesota, as well as an embedded May-term trip to the UK. 

“[E]very one of us is alive because others care for us,” argues Talia Schaffer. “None of us are autonomous; our very selfhood is intermeshed with others.” This course explores the concept of care and its history, ethics, philosophy through representations of care in literature. For Butler, the concept of care and relationality “furnishes a sense of political community of a complex order, and it does this first of all by bringing to the fore the relational ties that have implications for theorizing fundamental dependency and ethical responsibility.” Relationality and dependency are not only central to how we constitute ourselves, according to Butler, but are central to how we ought to think about politics differently. This course takes as its starting point Butler’s claim that we are constituted by those ties to others and, then, asks how our view of society, history, and literature changes when we prioritize the concept of care. 

You will work with the core question of how our view of society, history, and literature changes when we prioritize the concept of care. Through a variety of guest lectures on care as it relates to marginalized communities, as well as guided museum and site tours, you will gain an understanding of how care can help to create a more inclusive and just society for all.","3","3","No","1","3","A-F - A-F Grade Basis","000571","Periodic Spring"

What does this appetite tell us about our culture, ourselves? Whose concerns are elevated? Whose are ignored? And what does consuming this kind of media do to our perceptions of crime levels and safety? Is true crime exploitation or an opportunity for justice? In this course, we will look at the history of the genre, from murder ballads to nineteenth-century newspaper wars where publisher titans Hearst and Pulitzer sent reporters out to solve crimes. We’ll discuss Ida B. Wells’ coverage of the largely overlooked crime of lynching, and the creation of the “nonfiction novel” by Truman Capote with his classic In Cold Blood. We will also explore the influence of this nonfiction form on other genres, like the mystery novel, and analyze the effect of technology on these narratives. Crowdsourced investigations via social media and a return to the serial form of the 19th century in long-form podcasts have been some of the surprising results.

"TH","4382","Inventing Ireland","Twin Cities","What does the idea of being “Irish” mean? The content of this course will employ a cultural studies and performative theory approach to exploring the development and representation of Irish identity and “Irishness” in the 20th Century through the lens of literature, drama, and film.  The course will be a three-week long study abroad course with pre-departure readings and films, on-site readings of plays and short stories, and a final project due upon return.  By studying the history and works engaged in creating and interpreting this idea of Irish identity, both from and external to Ireland, students will be asked to engage in a more complex way with the ideas of heritage, culture, and national identity in general.  Students will also read selected of essays on culture and Irish history. ","3","3","No","1","3","A-F - A-F Grade Basis","-","Periodic Spring"
"YOST","1366","Stories of Resistance & Change: Youth, Race, Power & Privilege in the U.S.","Twin Cities","This course imagines literature as an opportunity to complement other understandings of youth, and to help those who work with children and adolescents to better understand their lived experiences. We will read classic and contemporary literary texts that respond to the needs, wants, and existential questions that surround young people’s lives, and makes them visible to learners in the class who want to better understand children and adolescents in diverse settings across the United States. Youth Studies at the University of Minnesota, prepares students to work towards understanding and helping to improve the everyday lives of diverse youth. By being in this class, reading our course texts carefully, and by engaging in learning activities with classmates, students have the chance to take away new understandings from powerful stories about youth. In fact, the texts in this course contain important descriptions of how oppression looks and feels to young people as they navigate institutions and see the impacts of structural inequality on themselves, communities, families, and friends. The young people in these texts show tremendous agency, and show meaningful examples of resistance on large and small scales. We will work together with course texts about how young people challenge and are challenged by their surroundings, and take away new meanings about how young people have promoted social justice and change. 

Learning activities in this class will include reading, writing, quizzes and exams and a course project. In class learning activities include discussion, presentations, activities, and a high level of participation is expected. Why literature? Literature can be thought of as one way of knowing about the daily lives of youth. Because literature offers a rich detailed framework of meaning showing the diverse contexts of lives of children, teenagers and young adults, youth workers can use the tools of literature to make youth work meanings from literature in which young people are primary to the text. Literature can make up a new lens through which learners can understand the daily and everyday lives of youth, and can complement the important social science lenses you may already bring to the class. Students are encouraged to develop a new set of questions about youth as they use the formal tools of literature to read literary texts that represent a range of styles, formats, themes, and choices. Diversity and Social Justice Literature that centers on young people from multicultural settings offers an opportunity to think about what it is that students already know about youth from diverse backgrounds, and to question whether their understanding is correct or if there are gaps in knowledge. In other words, a course goal will be to identify epistemological gaps between what we think we know about youth, race, gender, and power and privilege, and how that is confirmed and/or made more complicated by a larger body of knowledge about social constructions of power and privilege. This course calls on our literary texts to challenge and deconstruct dominant narratives about youth and their communities. Learners in this course enter into an ongoing conversation about what social justice for youth means in the context of unequal distribution of power and constructions of privilege and oppression.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Fall & Spring"
