"AAS","3301","Asian America Through Arts and Culture","Twin Cities","Americans of Asian descent comprise one of the fastest-growing racial groups in the U.S. today. While large numbers of Asian Americans have been in the U.S. since the middle of the nineteenth century, it is only in the past few decades that they have been widely recognized in art, culture, and media. This course focuses on how writing, art, performance, film, and/or other works of culture registers the experiences of Asian Americans past and present. How do individual artists or writers depict themselves and others as part of families, communities, or nations? How do questions of race, racism, family, identity, immigration, labor, citizenship, inequality, gender, sexuality, media stereotypes, and activism affect the perspectives and the creative choices in these works?","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Spring Even Year"
"AAS","3341","Asian American Images","Twin Cities","From 19th-century anti-Chinese political cartoons to Harold and Kumar, visual representations of Asians in the United States have long influenced how Asian Americans are seen and treated. What are some of the ways that photography, graphic arts, and digital culture have pictured Asian Americans as aliens, citizens, immigrants, workers, family and community members, entertainers, and artists? Course topics will relate visual images to particular historical moments, including the early exclusion period and the ""yellow peril"" stereotype; WWII Japanese American incarceration and the drawings of Miné Okubo, and photo-journalism documenting U.S. military involvement in Southeast Asia and its aftermath. How do photographic and other images work to counter historical amnesia, heal traumatic loss, and document social injustice? Other weeks of the class will explore the ways that individuals, families, and communities use photographs, video, and other visual media to preserve a sense of connection and belonging. We will also look at how contemporary Asian American photographers such as Tseng Kwong Chi, Nikki Lee, and Wing Young Huie experiment with visual images to raise questions of racial and national identity, social inequality, gender, sexuality, and political agency. The course also includes a digital storytelling project that encourages students to create video images and sound reflecting Asian American immigration stories from local communities.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Periodic Fall & Spring"
"AAS","3351","Asian Americans and Popular Culture","Twin Cities","Over the past few decades, Asian Americans have become increasingly visible both as the subjects and producers of popular culture in the United States. This course will explore how this new recognition of Asian Americans in popular literature, cinema, television, and entertainment is related both to longer histories of Asian immigration and racial exclusion and to post-1960s efforts to forward racial awareness, community activism, and social justice. Our first unit will look at how particular stereotypes such as the yellow peril or the wartime enemy encouraged anti-Asian feeling and violence and legal restrictions on immigration and naturalization. We will then examine how throughout history, Asian immigrants and their descendants used song, dance, theater, writing, and other forms of popular culture to express personal desires and foster collective ties. Our final unit concentrates on contemporary popular culture and its relationship to the changing identities of Asian Americans. How do Asian Americans influence the current essays, films, and videos that are consumed by millions today? How are increasingly pan-ethnic, interracial, multiracial, transnational, and global experiences reflected in popular culture?","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Periodic Fall & Spring"
"AAS","3409W","Asian American Women's Cultural Production","Twin Cities","This course explores cultural texts produced by and about Asian American women and queers. It wrestles with the complexities of a historical moment in which Asian American women are both increasingly visible in pop culture and increasingly visible targets of violence. We will push beyond judgments of “positive” or “negative” representations of Asian Americans and instead explore the political dimensions of these cultural representations—that is, how they animate, reference, or repress longer histories of migration, war, labor, and empire. We will approach the categories of both “Asian American” and “women” less as static identities and more as shifting political coalitions that bring together diverse groups of people whose experience of gender, sexuality, race, and class deviates from the norm of white, heterosexual, and cisgender American citizenship. In tracking (and at times celebrating) these deviations, we will ask: how might film, TV, literature, art, and theory help illuminate Asian American feminist politics?","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Fall"
"AFRO","3301","The Music of Black Americans","Twin Cities","This course examines the variety of ways African and African Americans express social history through music. It will consider the union of African elements and European elements that combined to present a new syncretized African-American product. To do this it is imperative that we explore the diversity of musical “voices” found within the African American culture. This diversity can be seen in the struggles to retain African cultural effects and the desire to be eclectic, creative, and contemporary. Such an approach to the study of the place of Black music in American music corresponds with the criteria of Diversity and Social Justice in the United States Liberal Education. The “multi-layered operation of power, prestige, and privilege” can be understood through an examination of the music of African Americans, which represents both a Free African voice and an enslaved African voice; the western-trained Black performer/composer and the self-taught performer/composer. It also represents the habits of well-to-do African Americans and the poor African Americans. Students will examine the complexities of the history of African Americans and how this is played out in the development of musical styles and genres. From this, students will then begin to understand how this unique diversity within a community affects those outside of those communities. Such an approach to the study of the place of Black music in American music corresponds with the criteria of Diversity and Social Justice in the United States Liberal Education.

We will follow elements found in West African culture and music such as ""call and response"" and the ""2nd Line"" as they travel to the ""New World"" and expressed through Spirituals, Symphonies, Gospel Music, Jazz, Rock and Roll, Step Bands and more. Through lectures, readings, discussion, audiovisual examples, and homework assignments student can expect to gain a deeper understanding of the ways music both reflects and influences the social history of all Americans.","3","3","No","1","3","A-F - A-F Grade Basis","-","Every Fall, Spring & Summer"
"AFRO","3578","Contemporary Sub-Saharan African Popular Art Forms","Twin Cities","This course explores popular art practices and representations – mediated through the lens of television, radio, popular cinema, sequential art, and the internet – as the everyday expressions of modern African identities. As sites where the tensions, frictions, collisions and notably, the productive creativities of the local and the global are circulated, negotiated and contested, African popular cultures provide insights into a unique and increasingly crucial facet of contemporary African artistic practice as critical intervention. The course is designed on the premise that Africans of all social strata and lifestyles are strategic and deliberate consumers of popular cultural forms, generated within local cultures as signifiers of larger social, political, and economic processes. In light of prevailing studies which sometimes end up naively celebrating agency and resistance, AFRO 3578 underscores the role of popular cultures as public/private sites of power's ideological and material (re-) production, contestation, or transformation. It considers creative practices as sites of both resistance and accommodation; of creative adaptation, innovation, and resilience. Through our discussion of communication technologies and their role in transmitting artistic and political ideas beyond the confines of dominant discourses and established institutions, we will evaluate the interface of technology and sociocultural shifts.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Periodic Fall & Spring"
"AFRO","3654","African Cinema","Twin Cities","This course introduces you to films written and directed by African filmmakers beginning the 2nd part of the 20th Century. Through an exploration of the stylistic and thematic issues raised by each film, it is expected that students will gain a broad understanding of how African filmmakers portray African social and cultural life, including the artistic and political contexts within which they work. In this way, students will gain an historical perspective on the origins of African filmmaking, confront the basic social, cultural, and aesthetic questions raised by African filmmakers and critics, and consider how questions raised by African filmmakers and their films fit into the larger context of world cinema. We will contrast postcolonial African films with Hollywood jungle epics, settler/adventure romances in safari paradise, and colonial movies about Africa. Moving beyond strict categories and standards we will also examine the role of documentary films in shaping our understanding of African people's lives and the social construction of reality. We will review the place of documentary film in the current media-scape and discuss its functions and limitations. Most films will be screened in original languages with English subtitles.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Periodic Fall & Summer"

"AFRO","3681","Black Central & Nordic Europe","Twin Cities","Europe is constantly associated with whiteness, yet Black people have existed in Northern and Central Europe (the contemporary spaces known as Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Scandinavia) for centuries. To counter this imagined whiteness, students will be reading histories and Black authors' experiences in these nations. A closer investigation will show that Black people have been traveling to Europe (willingly and unwillingly) for centuries. While Afro-Europeans remain at the margins of these nations, they find avenues to survive and thrive in the face of microaggressions and racism. As the semester progresses, we will examine the following questions: What is daily life like in a majority white country? In what ways are these authors included or excluded from national discourses? What ways do they bring attention to anti-Blackness in their local contexts? How do they define home and belonging? These questions will help us understand the imagined citizens of Central Europe and the people trying to tear these false images down.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Spring Even Year"

In recent years we have become accustomed to hearing about and debating the efficacy of the term and movement ""Black Lives Matter,"" but what, other than precarity, constitutes these lives that matter? How have black people collectively thrived even under conditions that would assume otherwise? In this course we will consider the myriad ways black people have gone about creating, dreaming, struggling, building, educating, loving, and living, even in the midst of all that works to bring death near. We will explore a range of cultural forms, including stand-up comedy, hip hop and R&B music, reality television, social media, and film, in order to contemplate the urgency and necessity of black social life, or, what it means to be with and for black people.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Spring"

"AMES","1351","Chinese Martial Arts Cinema","Twin Cities","Martial arts cinema may be China's most globally popular as well as most culturally distinctive form of film making. With origins in traditional Chinese popular literature and a cinematic history going back to the silent film era, the genre has experienced multiple periods of popularity both in China since the 1920s and in the West since the 1960s-70s. This course will look at Chinese martial arts cinema with these learning goals in mind:
- To learn the distinctive film style of the genre by discussing basic film techniques such as cinematography, editing, and performance.
- To use martial arts films to explore deeper aspects of Chinese culture such as philosophy, religion, and ethics.
- To see how the development of martial arts cinema reflected trends in modern Chinese history, including the tension between nationalism and globalism.
We will watch films from the pre-1949 Republic of China, the post-1949 People's Republic of China, Hong Kong during the British colonial period, and Taiwan.

This course provides a starting point for comprehending this frequently misunderstood part of the world, the diverse peoples who inhabit it, and the myriad cultures they practice. We will address the various problems we encounter when approaching such an unwieldy concept as “the Middle East,” key moments that have shaped modern Middle Eastern cultures and societies, and examples of how cultural production functions in the context of modern Middle Eastern history and politics.","3","3","No","1","3","OPN - Student Option No Audit","-","Periodic Fall & Spring"
"AMES","3256","Graphic Novels: Conflict, Peace and Protest","Twin Cities","This course will examine a particular medium—graphic novel—which is inherently rich in visual, narrative, and linguistic components. The materials chosen for this course are driven by wars and conflicts in the following four regions: East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. Through these selected works, we will explore histories of political conflicts, state violence, anticipation for peace as well as understandings and praxes of protest in various forms, namely, social movements; mourning; remembrance; art making; and writing. Given the nature of conflict that always goes above and beyond the question of nation-state, this course will also discuss its amplification to the question of migration, refugee crisis, displacement, and multi-generational trauma among diasporic subjects. Located at the intersection of conflict, peace, and protest, this course not only introduces students to historical processes and complexities of these conflicts—both from the national and international points of view—but also challenges students to question the potentials of graphic novels in mediating these histories and discourses around human rights for readers. Finally, this class explores ways in which we can engage with each other via our shared history and vulnerability, and questions whether peace and resolution promised to our generation via the discourse of human rights are, or will ever be, attainable.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Periodic Fall & Spring"

The class situates individual women writers within their specific historical settings and larger cultural backdrops, thus introducing students to literary themes, gender dynamics, and conditions of cultural production in Chinese history.

"AMES","3461","Martial Arts in Japan: Praxes, Philosophy, and Images in History","Twin Cities","	This course studies ""Martial arts in Japan"" by situating them in three phases of importance: 
(1) In medieval times (the 13-16th centuries), samurai—nominalized out of a verb, saburou (""to serve"")—came to overpower aristocrats, to whom they had literally been servers and servants in the previous classical era. With their martial skills, samurai became the major player of this era of multigenerational domestic belligerency. Ironically, martial arts had not yet existed during this ""age of samurai."" 
(2) Martial arts were born out of such medieval martial skills and theorized accordingly in the ensuing Edo era (1600-1867), when a major samurai household unified the country and materialized a long-lasting peacetime in which the ""real"" martial skills became increasingly irrelevant and devalued socially. 
(3) Then ""samurai"" also became irrelevant in modern times: the Meiji era (1868-1912) onward. For the last samurai government—the Edo shogunate—was unable to deal with then looming Western colonial powers and thus replaced by the first modern government, which chose rapid and intense westernization and modernization as their national policy to navigate amid the world-wide colonial milieu. Intriguingly, there emerged a certain discourse to identify the Japanese with ""samurai,"" despite the fact that ""samurai"" had only been a miniscule part of the population before, and while not being recognized overtly, ""martial arts"" seem to be a taken-for-granted, indispensable component of samurai images thus generated. Such images have continuously been amplified to date, with inevitable constant modifications, involving multiple media, not only texts in languages but also film, anime, manga, video game, etc.
	By historicizing ""martial arts"" in this manner, the course aims not only at (A) understanding them as effectively as possible, including such philosophical questions as ""body,"" ""body grammar,"" ""body-mind relationship,"" and, most fundamentally, ""performative nature of a being,"" but also at (B) experiencing firsthand the highly complicated and elusive relationship between what are called primary and secondary sources as well as the necessity to distinguish them nevertheless.
	This course is open to anyone with an interest. No prerequisite. No previous knowledge nor learning experience of martial arts and of Japanese is required. All reading assignments will be in English translation. Audio-visual materials will be used when available and appropriate.","3","3","No","1","3","OPN - Student Option No Audit","-","Periodic Fall & Spring"

We discuss the emergence of the Korean film industry under the conditions of colonial modernity and the various political pressures put on film production in South Korea until the 1990s. We will then turn to the last twenty years, during which South Korean film and television have experienced a boom in popularity in East Asia and globally.

By engaging with the academic scholarship on popular culture, we will learn how to analyze the stories, images, and sounds of Korean popular culture, while situating these within their various cultural and social contexts. Topics covered will include the Korean Wave (hallyu), the culture industry, digital platforms and economies, celebrity, fandom, and globalization.

The course is attentive to the impact of historical processes on cinema as well as to how film and media process historical events—colonialism, militarism, religious conflict, ideological wars, economic turmoil. The course is guided by three different problematics: the arrival of cinema as an imported technology that coincided with and was arguably contingent upon the European colonial presence in the region; the ideological conflicts of the Cold War, anti-Communist sentiments; and the emergence of national film industries vis-à-vis independent cinema in the contemporary time. The latter sees cinema as a recuperative means, on the one hand, from political trauma and, on the other hand, from the ongoing human rights crises and the decline of democracy in the region.

"AMES","3766","Hmong Textiles and Identities","Twin Cities","This is a lecture, discussion, and project-based learning course on the multi-faceted Hmong identities throughout regions of different countries, time-periods, and acculturation process of each region. The course analyzes authentic materials, texts, and media about the utilization of Artistic Textiles as well as Functional Textiles (clothing) in everyday Hmong life as well as identity frameworks. Hmong textiles and embroideries are key elements to Hmong identities, and directly reflect the diaspora, culture, location, dialect, and practice of each group and sub-group. International Hmong identities are identified and studied in order to critically analyze the foundations of the Hmong American identity. Students learn how to interpret each region's textiles and embroideries and how they represent embroidered language and identities. Although there will be a focus on Asia, this class also focuses on an international Hmong identity which includes the United States and other countries of the Hmong diasporic journey. The class analyzes the role textiles play in today's international Hmong population, Hmong ethnic identity, transformation, advancement, social justice, and commodification. This course is taught in English, there are no prerequisites, and students are not required to have taken any Hmong language classes.

"AMES","3857","Iranian Society through Cinema","Twin Cities","In this course, we will understand contemporary Iranian society and culture through the lens of Iran's postrevolutionary cinema. Internationally renowned for its artistic, thematic, and narrative prowess, post-revolutionary Iranian cinema is unique in its ability to capture the aspirations, struggles, and triumphs of ordinary Iranians as they manage life in the Islamic Republic. In moving beyond stereotypical images presented by mass media, modern Iranian cinema provides a medium for us to delve into the complex makeup of issues such as religion, gender, class, and politics in Iran today. How does Iranian cinema reflect Iran's culture, society and politics? What role does Iranian cinema play in shaping Iran's national identity? What new insights does Iranian cinema shed onto the interests, subjectivities, and desires of Iranians themselves? Throughout this course, we will attempt to answer these questions by viewing a number of masterpieces of Iranian cinema and reading related social, historical, and political analyses. By engaging in an exploration of daily life in Iran through film, we will gain a more nuanced understanding of Iran's modern landscape and the diversity of opinions and experiences that it constitutes. This course will also serve as an introduction to Iranian history, especially following the 1979 revolution. By examining how Iranian cinema is intimately linked with this history, students will gain a better understanding of the significant role that cinema has played in shaping Iran today.","3","3","No","1","3","A-F - A-F Grade Basis","-","Periodic Fall & Spring"
"AMES","3867","Orientalism and the Arab World","Twin Cities","This course explores the various manners in which “the Arab World” is constructed and re/presented in American and European discourses. Reading through scholarly writings, literature, visual arts, and popular media, this course illuminates the manner in which the idea of a monolithic “Arab World” and quintessential “Arab” subject are constructed and re/produced for western consumption. Crucially, this course also examines the manner in which this re/production of the “Arab World/Subject” is integral to the construction of western identity itself – serving as a foil to western self-conceptualization. 

The concept of orientalism was introduced into western scholarship by Edward Said through his seminal 1978 work, Orientalism, often credited as a foundational text in the field of postcolonial studies. In the first part of the course, we will closely read Orientalism and some of the influential critical engagements with Said’s book. We will also discuss how orientalist discourse has been subsumed under the debates on the “Clash of Civilizations” and “The War on Terror” in the 21st century. The second part of the course will look at orientalist representations in a variety of mediums, from literature and visual art to video games. In the final part of the course, we will try to “inventory the traces” of Orientalism on the Oriental subject, or examine the manner Arab artists and writers have engaged with orientalism’s legacies.

In this course, we will develop a well-rounded understanding of Islamic mysticism, highlighting its diverse manifestations across historical periods and regions while exploring its literary dimensions, spiritual practices, and enduring influence on Islamic intellectual, social, and political life. We will trace the development of Islamic mysticism from its beginnings in the ninth century to the present, exploring its various trajectories around the globe. With this historical foundation in hand, each week we will focus on a different theme, such as Sufi approaches to the Qur'an, love poetry, rituals and practices, saintly miracles and shrine visitation, and Sufism's role in the political sphere. Special attention will be given to how Sufism is intertwined with the social and political life of Muslims in both medieval and contemporary times. The course will end with an examination of Sufism in the modern period, its relationship to colonialism, and the tensions that have arisen between Sufism and its detractors. Throughout the semester, we will engage with a wide range of materials, including poetry translations, news articles, medieval texts, musical performances, short films, and more.

What does it mean to view oneself as living through a revival? How does this view shape the contours of the past, or of the future? This class will address these questions through a survey of the political, intellectual, social, and cultural aspects of Arab modernity. We will examine how Arab thinkers of the late 19th and early 20th century produced new genres, identities, and communal affiliations to narrate their experience of modernity, which they often coded as “the encounter with the West.” Our readings, all in English translation, will cover the first confrontations (and love affairs) with European powers, the self-professed urgency of projects of reforming language, literature, and cultural institutions, the growing schism between religious and secular thought, and the attempts to articulate indigenous alternatives to Western-style modernity.

"AMES","3886","Petrofictions: Oil Wars, Wealth, and Waste in the Middle East","Twin Cities","In 1992, the novelist Amitav Ghosh wondered why the ""oil-encounter,"" the most significant, culture-altering development of the twentieth century, has not been narrativized. Twenty years later, in The Great Derangement, he concluded that our prevalent narrative forms are inadequate to narrate the slow catastrophe of climate change, simply because they are so implicated, even complicit, in the extractive logics of petromodernity. 

This course explores our contemporary modernity of oil dependence through critical engagement with Middle Eastern cultural production. It postulates that to think about oil is not solely to think about derricks or spectacular spills or barrel prices, but about the basic narratives, fictions, and ideologies that underline our daily lives; that reading fictions (conceived broadly) is both a method and resource to map and critique ways in which the world's resources are unevenly produced, extracted, and exploited on a global-local scale; and that humanistic inquiry can challenge the common assumption that existing energy systems are inevitably necessary in modern life. Throughout the semester, the students will engage in critical readings of novels, films, and visual art that emerge from and react to the networked reality of an oil-addicted world. They will critically analyze the narrative forms and visual vocabularies through which the petro-industry has been depicted, as well as learn about the violent history of oil extraction and its environmental effects. Finally, they will consider how creative works allow us to imagine and promote alternative and more sustainable energy futures.","3","3","No","1","3","A-F - A-F Grade Basis","-","Periodic Fall & Spring"

The American family only exists within US mythology built on imperialism and settler colonialism. This course will explore how the heteronormative nuclear family structure symbolizes modern capitalist society that emphasizes the core American values of individualism, democracy, and the ability to reproduce. Thus, the individual family members are not only transformed into productive citizens but are also tasked with the responsibility to reproduce the nation(alism). For example, the recent advancement for gay marriage is scripted as a new phenomenon that poses as both a threat to the American values and a sign of progress. This paradox exposes the limits of gay identity politics and nationalist ideology within neoliberalism, which later used to justify and rationalize racist and xenophobic ideologies.

"AMST","3409W","Asian American Women's Cultural Production","Twin Cities","This course explores cultural texts produced by and about Asian American women and queers. It wrestles with the complexities of a historical moment in which Asian American women are both increasingly visible in pop culture and increasingly visible targets of violence. We will push beyond judgments of “positive” or “negative” representations of Asian Americans and instead explore the political dimensions of these cultural representations—that is, how they animate, reference, or repress longer histories of migration, war, labor, and empire. We will approach the categories of both “Asian American” and “women” less as static identities and more as shifting political coalitions that bring together diverse groups of people whose experience of gender, sexuality, race, and class deviates from the norm of white, heterosexual, and cisgender American citizenship. In tracking (and at times celebrating) these deviations, we will ask: how might film, TV, literature, art, and theory help illuminate Asian American feminist politics?","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Periodic Spring"

This class explores the history of visual culture and the fine arts in the United States, from the 1600s to the present. Our goal is to understand how images and objects define what being ""American"" means—for individuals and for the public—and to see how art is a place where identity can be challenged, expanded, and transformed. Through interactive, art-based lectures, you will learn the skills of visual analysis, historical research, and art appreciation. Whether looking at a tea set designed by Paul Revere, poppies painted by Georgia O'Keeffe, or a Midwestern landscape fashioned out of wood by George Morrison: we'll use art to ask big questions about American experience.

This class will examine topics including transgender saints, miraculous transformations, demonic possession, female artists and patrons, the ""monstrous races"" of travel accounts, and gender-affirming surgeries. In contrast to misconceptions of a homogenous white European past, the reality of medieval Europe was diverse and complex, and its boundaries - geographical, cultural, bodily, and otherwise - were in flux, as reflected in its visual and material culture.

Beginning with the landmark 1874 exhibition, which gave the ragtag group of avant-garde artists its name, it will follow the development of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art through the late nineteenth century before exploring twentieth- and twenty-first century counterpoints to the now-canonical artworks of Manet, Degas, Monet, Morisot, Caillebotte, Renoir, Gauguin, Van Gogh, and others. 

Through a mixture of lectures, readings, class discussion, walking tours, and the close, careful study of original artworks at the Louvre, Musée d’Orsay, Musée Marmottan, and elsewhere, students will learn about the connection between Impressionism and the city where it first emerged; art-market, collecting and curatorial practices; the reception of Impressionism abroad; and, finally, how scholarly interpretations of Impressionist artworks have changed over time.

From formal analysis to more recent art historical approaches, informed by gender and sexuality studies and postcolonial theory, the course will bring students to consider the merits and limitations of studying the ‘‘canon’’ and what, if anything, remains to be said about Impressionism today.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Periodic Spring"

Does Ruben Salazar’s bluntly stated notion of a “Chicano” suggest an answer? “A Chicano [Chicana or Chicanx] is a Mexican-American with a non-Anglo image of himself [herself or themselves]” (Los Angeles Times, 1970). Chicano, Chicana, and Chicanx identities crystalized during the Chicano Movement (1965-1980), which witnessed the rise of collective mobilizations to improve the labor conditions, education, housing, health, and civil rights for Mexican Americans. From its inception, the Chicano Movement attracted artists who created a new aesthetic and framework for producing art, but they did not merely illustrate the social and civil rights movement by creating posters and flyers. Artists theorized, negotiated, proposed, and initiated new ethics, aesthetics, and ways of thinking that supported self-determination, hope, social critique, solidarity, and justice. Increasingly since the 1980s, Chicanas and Chicanx artists renegotiated this social justice contract. Chicana/o/x art continues to inform Mexican American cultural production and the nation’s cultural heritage. Social intervention, empowerment, and institutional critique remain some of the most important innovations of American artists, Chicana/o/x artists among them.","3","3","No","1","3","A-F - A-F Grade Basis","-","Every Fall"

We encounter them every day on this campus whether we are at the Bell Museum of Natural History pondering Charles Corwin’s diorama of beavers at Lake Itasca, in the James Ford Bell Library examining Jean Baptiste Nolin’s seventeenth-century map of the Pays d’en Haut (“Upper Country”), or looking from the steps of Northrop Auditorium across the green spaces and architecture of the state’s land-grant university. These images exert a powerful influence on us, making our world cohere and forming the basis of strong communal identities. At the same time, without knowledge of their histories and conventions, they can stand as barriers to a more complex sense of the ground we stand on. This course will examine broadly the landscapes of the “North Country,” the area roughly corresponding to present-day Minnesota that has for thousands of years been home to the Dakota and Ojibwe peoples and their ancestors, and more recently to peoples of European descent who in the seventeenth century began to refashion the landscape of the North Country in their own image.

"ARTH","3401W","Art on Trial","Twin Cities","Why does art so often elicit anger, debate, protest, and vandalism? Arts controversies raise many difficult questions that this class examines: should artists be allowed to use taxpayer funds to create works of art critical of the government or that some find offensive? Should public sculptures commemorate Confederates, slave owners, or colonialists? How do we know when something is obscene? Is censorship ethical? Do artists have the right to control the fate of their work after it is sold? Who should decide what artists are chosen for public commissions, what artworks are selected for public buildings, or how works of art should be interpreted? Does public opinion make bad art? This course trains students in the history of arts controversies in the United States from the 19th century to the present and in the changing social conditions through which art has become a flashpoint for public debate. Assignments focus on discipline-specific research and writing techniques that build toward a group project in which students research, take up positions, and debate the merits of important case studies. The class is primarily designed for students to learn about the arts and arts policy today, i.e., the art world of which they are and will be citizens.

"ARTH","3434","Art and the Environment","Twin Cities","Western art has a long tradition of depicting and directly engaging with the environment—from ancient earthworks such as Stonehenge and Avebury Stone Circle, to 18th and 19th century landscape paintings and 20th century photographs, to land and earth art of the 1960s and ‘70s, and what is now called environmental or eco art. Such art has had a prominent place in art’s history, but do we really need art to save the environment? Studies repeatedly show that the arts are crucial to understanding and forestalling environmental disaster because, it turns out, human attitudes are shaped by the stories we tell, by our ability to imagine the unimaginable, to accept the inanimate as potentially coming to life, to picture things on a vast scale. In this course students learn the historical development of artistic movements from 1968, when the first exhibition of such art, called “Earthworks,” took place at the Dwan Gallery in New York, up to the present day. The course tracks the changing aesthetic, political, and climatic forces that influenced such art, from the anti-institutionalism and participatory approaches of the 1960s to the more activist artistic engagement with environmentalism today. The class takes up two primary concerns: understanding the historical and scientific conditions that have given rise to such art and learning the ways in which artists have sought to intervene in and affect a changing environment. Students put historical knowledge, environmental research, and visual analysis skills to work in a culminating group project creating art that responds to a contemporary environmental problem.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Periodic Fall & Spring"

Throughout the semester we will be looking at contemporary and historical works of art as examples of how a broad range of diverse artists have explored the concepts and materials they use in their work and how this applies to the work you create. Critiques will be used as a tool for developing critical thinking and project development. You can expect by the end of this course to discover your individual creative processes and feel comfortable and safe working independently in a sculpture studio. You will be prepared for advanced sculpture and foundry and metal casting courses.

Music, as a mode that both creates and reflects culture, provides key insight into political and social systems. Whether we are studying early border ballads by Chelo Silva who challenged gender norms or learning about Bad Bunny’s commitment to revitalizing Puerto Rico’s electrical grid after Hurricane Maria, we will focus on how the musical production impacts broader society. Readings from scholars in Chicana/o/x and Latina/o/x Studies will ground our analysis of music through an intersectional lens. We will unpack the race, class, and gender dynamics that are evident in a particular musical production. Moreover, we will analyze the artist’s positionality (identities in a particular context) to discuss issues of power and resistance. 

The course units are organized in a flexible chronology and by genre. The material ranges from traditional musical styles such as the corrido and bolero to contemporary genres like punk and hip hop. To fully immerse ourselves in Chicana/o/x and Latina/o/x music there are both reading assignments and listening assignments for each class session. When possible, there are also visuals (music videos) that will provide an additional layer for us to analyze. Throughout the semester you will write about individual songs, albums, music videos, and artists by applying course concepts and theories to the work. The final project will culminate in a podcast where you record alone or in a group an episode on a particular musician, album, genre, or musical moment.

"CI","1032","Creating Identities: Learning In and Through the Arts","Twin Cities","“Creating Identities: Learning In and Through the Arts” gives you opportunities to create art in different mediums including storytelling, photomontage, movement, as well as a creative medium of your choice in order to reflect your understanding of a social justice issue. In CI 1032 you join a learning community for discussing, analyzing, and making meaning of this artistic production. No prior experience is needed; come with an open mind and imagination as well as a willingness to experiment. An important emphasis in the class will be on finding your own ways to transform ordinary materials. We will introduce you to specific artistic techniques and in turn you will learn to take creative risks, think metaphorically, explore the unknown, improvise, brainstorm, and invent your own methods of working. Each of you bring to the class different kinds of knowledge and abilities. To be successful in this course you need to be willing to work hard, to explore territory that may not be familiar to you, to be reflective about what you are doing, and to learn from your diverse classmates and in turn help them achieve the same goals.
 
The instructors of “Creating Identities: Learning In and Through the Arts” shape the course with the assumption that identity is at the heart of educational experiences and that the habits of mind associated with the artistic production are primary vehicles for multimodal learning. We will experience how arts-based learning engenders higher order thinking, the creative process, reflection and perseverance. This course gives you the opportunity to both produce as well as analyze art in order to experience how creative expressions reveal aspects of our personal and social identities that have an impact on how we learn. Through mediums including photography, film, performance, music, painting and sculpture, we will explore how artists are influenced by cultural elements such as the built and natural environments, gender, religion, nationality, and socioeconomic status, and how artists, in turn, shape our perceptions of culture and identity. Through writing and discussion, we will consider how the arts can both reflect and impact our perceptions of identity and our reflections of ourselves as learners.
 
As you move further into your academic studies and your career, you will intersect with people from differing cultures and places. The work in this class will help you become more comfortable with and welcome the benefits that come with intercultural learning. Interactions with classmates and cultural production of indigenous, immigrant, international and Western artists, allows you to have a greater understanding of, appreciation for and acceptance of the ways of knowing a variety of cultures can provide, and the confidence that you can reciprocate in kind.","4","4","No","1","4","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Fall & Spring"

One of our aims will be to explore students’ relations as viewers and documentarians themselves (via smartphones, Instagram, etc.) to this participatory, revelatory, and always controversial, politically fraught film practice. 

Documentary Cinema includes both full class lectures and discussions as well as small group discussion of films and readings, and may include the opportunity for students to create their own personal documentary. Intellectually, the course balances out a study of the grammar of documentary as an artistic practice with explorations of the ways the genre reflects broader currents of cinematic and cultural history. By the end of the semester, students should have a stronger understanding of the ways documentary cinema opens our senses to the world around us.","4","4","No","1","4","OPT - Student Option","-","Periodic Fall & Spring"

"CSCL","3251","Popular Music and Mass Culture","Twin Cities","This course investigates the ways popular music is imbricated with the our identities, social affiliations and attitudes towards others on the scale of millions of people—what we might call “mass culture.” We will explore how popular music produces emotion, a sense of intoxication, and erotic desire; how it can be linked with self-discipline, bodily exercise, state security, sovereign authority, patriotism, courage, punishment, and violence; and how music might be heard related to labor and work, consumerism and consumption, and capitalism more broadly. We will puzzle over the ways music can give coherence to a cultural group, accompany moral education and action, challenge or reinforce gender conventions, mobilize and disperse political resistance, or lead one into a trance of spiritual and religious ecstasy. While we will still attend to a variety of “purely” musical elements both large and small (chords, verses, choruses, singing styles, lyrics, etc.), our central focus will be on forming a more philosophical view of its functions within popular culture. Genres to be discussed include rock, pop, hip-hop, R&B, electronic dance music, performances of the national anthem, and experimental music.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Fall & Spring"

"CSCL","3405","Marx for Today","Twin Cities","A century and a half after the publication of Karl Marx’s Capital, Vol. 1 (1867), this course will reflect on the political urgency of our current moment in order to understand the relevance and complexity of Marx and the Marxist tradition. We will pursue an intensive study of primary readings written by Karl Marx himself, exploring the social, philosophical, and political history of Marxist thought and familiarizing ourselves with key concepts such as labor-power, primitive accumulation, the commodity, use value, exchange-value, surplus-value, crisis, money, and capital. As we study Marx as a theoretician, we will also examine his work as a political revolutionary, writer, and correspondent with many of the most important revolutionary figures of his day. Here we will foreground his analysis of the labor of enslaved Black persons in the plantation economies of the Southern United States—which he ties to the labor markets of capitalism in Europe—as well as his more explicit critiques of slavery and colonialism.

Following this close reading of Marx and the Marxist tradition, we will consider the ways that critical thinkers and political activists, both in the United States and globally, continue to resist, create, and dream under the banner of Marxism throughout the twentieth century and into our own new century. We will center questions of racial justice through the writings of W. E. B. Du Bois and contemporary Marxist scholars of race, indigeneity, and diaspora, focusing on Du Bois’s attention to the links between race and social class in America. Alongside critical reappraisals of Marx’s thought, we shall think about the influence of Marx’s writings on political activists in the Black Panther Party and the American Indian Movement, and on American labor, as well as on South American revolutionaries like Carlos Marighella. We will then move to a study of Marxist feminism, linking race and gender in U.S. and global Marxisms through readings by Black Panther activist and intellectual Angela Davis, the social historian Nancy Fraser, and Italian Marxist feminist Silvia Federici. We will revisit the question of gender oppression and feminist resistance through a Marxist frame, with reference to the revival of socialist prospects in the work of Jodi Dean and Mackenzie Wark. Finally, we will examine the contemporary fight over reproductive rights and the history of the “Wages for Housework” movement.
From these readings and conversations we will think about how Marx’s ideas and their larger legacy can help us to understand our current moment and our political, social, and ecological futures. In as much as this is a course on theoretical perspectives, it will also be one that seeks to use Marx, and the Marxist tradition, to develop critical perspectives and solutions to pressing issues of racial injustice, social inequality, and environmental devastation.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Spring"
"CSCL","3425W","Critical Theory and Social Change","Twin Cities","This course introduces students to influential thinkers in the field of critical theory, broadly conceived. Critical theory is similar to philosophy because it asks big questions that stretch the boundaries of human knowledge. But it is distinct in its focus on practical change—critical theory advocates for a more just and emancipated human world. Its key techniques are the diagnosis and critique of histories, systems, and ideologies of social power. Critical theory emerged from a group of Marxist intellectuals in the 1920s and 30s who were concerned about the rise of fascism, the staggering inequalities produced by industrial capitalism, the trauma of mass violence, and the numbing standardization of modern life. Since then, the field has expanded to encompass concerns about structural racism, gender inequality, the rise of neoliberalism, the expansion of modern carceral and mental health systems, and the ongoing inequities wrought by histories of slavery, colonization, and imperial conquest. Featured authors may include Sigmund Freud, W. E. B. Du Bois, Georg Simmel, Walter Benjamin, Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, Frantz Fanon, Herbert Marcuse, Patricia Hill Collins, Malcom X, Jackie Wang, Angela Y. Davis, Sheldon George, Alfredo Carrasquillo, Joshua Javier Guzman, Willy Apollon, Jean Rouch, Michel-Rolph Trouillot, Saidiya Hartman, bell hooks, Édouard Glissant, Aurora Levins Morales, Michael Rothberg, Nelson Maldonado-Torres, Christopher Pexa, Yuichiro Onishi, Kwame Anthony Appiah, Lewis Gordon, and Barbara Christian.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Fall & Spring"

Or does a film inspire you to go back and read the original book, to see what the filmmakers changed or left out? Either way, if you love book covers that say ""Now a major motion picture,"" this is the class for you. ""Adaptation: Literature to Film"" explores the historical, cultural, and aesthetic contexts in which both literary and cinematic texts are produced and received. We will ask such questions as: When we read a book or a play and then watch an adaptation of it, are we in any sense encountering the ""same"" text? Does the intention of the author necessarily define the meaning of a text, as readers see it? What other elements enter into the formulation of meaning(s)? How are elements of an inter-textual system always, in some sense, ""in dialogue"" with each other, and how do different media affect us differently -- whether emotionally, aesthetically, or intellectually? In this class you will learn skills related to interpreting and writing about both literature and moving image media (i.e., film, television, animation, etc.), including concepts and vocabulary specific to each, and your written assignments will include close readings of both books and films.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Fall & Spring"

Sometimes these films will be obviously queer or trans. However, queer and trans film is often coded or distorted, especially in response to legal or societal censorship or disapproval. As a result, Queer directors and writers sometimes speak in a liberatory way to particular oppressed/silenced groups on the level of coded content, but if the content is consumed out of context of the code, the experience of a film may be contradictory, even offensive. Consequently we'll be looking for the queer subversions within the distortions.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Spring"

In addition to being the subjects of book bans, graphic novels break down the boundary between high “art” and popular culture. Compared to a comic, which is periodical, a graphic novel is a complete story presented as a book, sometimes in installments. However, as a hybrid form containing language and image, a graphic novel blends and transcends both. Because graphic novels represent people of all kinds, identity is a central theme, as is the body. What histories form, and what full or partial information about our past or pasts become apparent? We will discuss widely varying representations of race, gender, sexuality, and national/cultural identity, addressing historical and cultural contexts. In addition, we will pay close attention to different forms and juxtapositions in both the visual and linguistic aspects of the texts, considering how particular choices, techniques and strategies affect us intellectually, aesthetically, emotionally, and politically.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Fall & Spring"

All films manipulate us, using visual techniques that seduce us into identifying with certain characters and narratives. How do some films uphold the prevailing social order concerning sexualities and genders while others challenge it? Can movies have hidden subtexts, sometimes deeply subversive, that are “coded” and readable only to certain audiences? We will explore these questions in films from a variety of national cinemas and historical periods, from the 1910s to the present.

This course focuses on how writing, art, performance, film, and/or other works of culture registers the experiences of Asian Americans past and present.

How did Oscar Wilde surreptitiously signal his sexuality through a satire of Victorian seriousness in The Importance of Being Earnest? How do contemporary playwrights such as August Wilson or Lynn Nottage bring forgotten moments of African American history to light? This course shows how modern and contemporary theater presents original perspectives on human identities and relationships as well as encourages audiences to see the world in new ways. This course focuses on the close analysis and interpretation of plays written by dramatists from around the world from the late-nineteenth to the twenty-first century. The plays we will study are set in Europe, Great Britain, North America, Africa, and Asia, and we will examine each carefully in light of the unique historical and social contexts in which they were produced, their creation and uses of aesthetic form, and their impact on individuals and communities.

Through the course, you will become familiar with such dramatic forms as the well-made play, modern satire, realism, expressionism, symbolism, epic theater, and absurdism. Each of these is interesting not only as a distinctive mode of artistic  presentation, but also as it offers different perspectives on historical moments and present-day concerns about people and their communities. Theatrical works illustrate how the meanings ascribed to physical bodies are at the heart of social differences such as gender, sexuality, class, race, disability, and national identity. We will look at each play in its original cultural context as well as through the creative lens of more recent productions and assess how both historical and more recent reimagining changes the meaning of the work. We will also make use of the rich theatrical resources and cultural organizations available in communities such as the Twin Cities.

It focuses on how migrants, regular and clandestine migrations, as well as related themes, including globalization, hospitality and transnational modes of transportation have been filmed, discussed and written about in various types of discourses. 

Why and how do people emigrate? Where are the major destinations of migrants? What is Fortress Europe? What is the “global South?” What is the so-called refugee crisis? Who is a refugee? What impact has the Arab Spring had on contemporary migrations to Europe? How does mass media portray the global South? What do political discourses tell us about the European and North African handlings of recent human migratory movements? Can artists effectively put forward an alternate take on such issues? What types of responses in artistic productions as well as in the political and humanitarian arenas have failed attempts at crossing the Mediterranean Sea triggered?

Students will develop skills in close-looking, visual analysis, and historical interpretation through close-looking exercises carried out in class and through written assignments. Class lectures will occasionally be supplemented by field trips to museums such as the Weisman Art Museum, Minneapolis Institute of Art, and Walker Art Center, where students will have the opportunity to discuss and analyze original works of art in person. Class discussions, readings, and assignments will all be in English, with additional German-language texts available for interested students.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Fall Odd Year"

As a result, Queer directors and writers sometimes speak in a liberatory way to particular oppressed/silenced groups on the level of coded content, but if the content is consumed out of the context of the code, the experience of a film may be contradictory, even offensive.

To counter this imagined whiteness, students will be reading histories and Black authors’ experiences in these nations. A closer investigation will show that Black people have been traveling to Europe (willingly and unwillingly) for centuries. While Afro-Europeans remain at the margins of these nations, they find avenues to survive and thrive in the face of microaggressions and racism. As the semester progresses, we will examine the following questions: What is daily life like in a majority white country? In what ways are these authors included or excluded from national discourses? What ways do they bring attention to anti-Blackness in their local contexts? How do they define home and belonging? These questions will help us understand the imagined citizens of Central Europe and the people trying to tear these false images down.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Spring Even Year"

We will push beyond judgments of “positive” or “negative” representations of Asian Americans and instead explore the political dimensions of these cultural representations—that is, how they animate, reference, or repress longer histories of migration, war, labor, and empire. We will approach the categories of both “Asian American” and “women” less as static identities and more as shifting political coalitions that bring together diverse groups of people whose experience of gender, sexuality, race, and class deviates from the norm of white, heterosexual, and cisgender American citizenship. In tracking (and at times celebrating) these deviations, we will ask: how might film, TV, literature, art, and theory help illuminate Asian American feminist politics?","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Fall"

How did the representation of the human being in poetry, drama, and figurative arts interplay with the new medical culture and practices at that time? This course will examine the dynamic interchange and engagement of Western Renaissance medical culture (before 1800) in relation to literary, visual and performing arts, approaching questions that cross disciplinary, geographical, and social boundaries.  Topics to be addressed include historical questions related to the intersection between the late European medieval university’s programs of medicine and arts, humanistic culture, and medical charlatanism. Moreover, we will focus on the ephemeral rituals of medical and performative practices and the visual culture in works of art and scientific illustrated treatises of life, death, and the afterlife. Finally, we will explore the embodiments in poetry and drama of illness and metaphor, gender conflicts, and medical, spiritual, and philosophical views of what it meant to be human. By exploring the value of humanistic study and medical ethical concerns in Renaissance humanism, students will understand the historical sources of a modern humanistic formation and be informed about the importance of ethics to citizenship, reconsidering the present vision of a humanistic education and imagining the future in the academic humanities and in our society. The course will culminate in a digital project involving students in the creation of a virtual exhibit on the course topics, by using the New Builder StoryMaps software proposed by DASH/U-Spatial.

"HSEM","3072H","Leonardo da Vinci: Between Art and Science, History and Myth","Twin Cities","This course is designed to introduce students to Leonardo da Vinci the historical man, and to his rich body of work produced during his lifetime from 1462-1519. It is also designed to consider as well how a mythic understanding of Leonardo da Vinci was also fashioned from this same historical foundation, turning him into an almost supernatural icon of the universal creative genius. Especially noteworthy in the mythic idea of Leonardo is his seeming transcendence of the imagined “Two Cultures” divide between the Arts and the Sciences, and his identity as a virtuoso artist in multiple domains simultaneously (painting, scuplture, architecture, and the visual arts overall) a pioneering figure in science, engineering, and the history of technology in fields ranging from anatomy to hydraulics and engineering to physics. How, this course will ask, did each of these aspects of Leonardo’s work come to be a part of his historical life and accomplishments, and how after his death was his fully historical life and work refashioned into our contemporary mythistorical understanding of Leonardo as a singular universal genius and seemingly supernatural ""Renaissance Man""? 

The course will pursue these topics in three parts. Part I (Weeks 1-7) will be devoted to the historical Leonardo, and during spring break (March 3-12) we pursue Part II by traveling to Italy to experience Leonardo’s Italy as it exists today, and to start connecting the historical life with the imagined legacy of it. In Part III (weeks 12-15), we will consider the invention of the mythistory of Leonardo in the centuries after his death, especially the forging in the modern era (after 1870) of his contemporary identity as a seemingly magical and superhuman creative genius who defies interpretation in ordinary historical terms.

France has a complex relationship with Jews since the Middle Ages. During the French Revolution (1789), then under the Empire (Napoleon Bonaparte, 1800-1815), the Jews benefitted from political emancipation. The Republic defended the equality of Jews before the law as French citizens. But France was also the country of political anti-Semitism and of the Dreyfus Affair (there were in the nineteenth century some very virulent anti-Semitic propaganda writers, for example Edouard Drumont, author of Jewish France, in 1880, just before the Dreyfus Affair). This history of the Jews in France culminates with the Vichy regime, the policy of collaboration with Nazi Germany, antisemitic writings and propaganda emanating from important writers such as Louis-Ferdinand Celine and politicians, and the deportation of part of the Jewish population to the extermination camps. How does this story affect fictional writing, and debates on how to represent this event? More than a course on the Holocaust, we explore the story of its reminiscence in French culture.

Music, as a mode that both creates and reflects culture, provides key insight into political and social systems. Whether we are studying early border ballads by Chelo Silva who challenged gender norms or learning about Bad Bunny’s commitment to revitalizing Puerto Rico’s electrical grid after Hurricane Maria, we will focus on how the musical production impacts broader society. Readings from scholars in Chicana/o/x and Latina/o/x Studies will ground our analysis of music through an intersectional lens. We will unpack the race, class, and gender dynamics that are evident in a particular musical production. Moreover, we will analyze the artist’s positionality (identities in a particular context) to discuss issues of power and resistance. 

The course units are organized in a flexible chronology and by genre. The material ranges from traditional musical styles such as the corrido and bolero to contemporary genres like punk and hip hop. To fully immerse ourselves in Chicana/o/x and Latina/o/x music there are both reading assignments and listening assignments for each class session. When possible, there are also visuals (music videos) that will provide an additional layer for us to analyze. Throughout the semester you will write about individual songs, albums, music videos, and artists by applying course concepts and theories to the work.

"MUS","3301","The Music of Black Americans","Twin Cities","This course examines the variety of ways African and African Americans express social history through music. It will consider the union of African elements and European elements that combined to present a new syncretized African-American product. To do this it is imperative that we explore the diversity of musical ""voices"" found within the African American culture. This diversity can be seen in the struggles to retain African cultural effects and the desire to be eclectic, creative, and contemporary. Such an approach to the study of the place of Black music in American music corresponds with the criteria of Diversity and Social Justice in the United States Liberal Education. The ""multi-layered operation of power, prestige, and privilege"" can be understood through an examination of the music of African Americans, which represents both a Free African voice and an enslaved African voice; the western-trained Black performer/composer and the self-taught performer/composer. It also represents the habits of well-to-do African Americans and the poor African Americans. Students will examine the complexities of the history of African Americans and how this is played out in the development of musical styles and genres. From this, students will then begin to understand how this unique diversity within a community affects those outside of those communities. Such an approach to the study of the place of Black music in American music corresponds with the criteria of Diversity and Social Justice in the United States Liberal Education.

 We will follow elements found in West African culture and music such as ""call and response"" and the ""2nd Line"" as they travel to the ""New World"" and expressed through Spirituals, Symphonies, Gospel Music, Jazz, Rock and Roll, Step Bands and more. Through lectures, readings, discussion, audiovisual examples, and homework assignments student can expect to gain a deeper understanding of the ways music both reflects and influences the social history of all Americans.","3","3","No","1","3","A-F - A-F Grade Basis","-","Every Fall, Spring & Summer"

We will learn to suss out bad argumentation, and pinpoint the precise mistake in reasoning that is at fault in particular cases. Patterns will emerge, which will help us learn how to better argue for beliefs that we hold, and claims we take to be true. We will especially focus on developing these skills in various, real-world contexts, so that they can be transferable to your future life, career, and decision-making.

These changes posed extraordinary challenges to usual ways of conceiving of political order and governance. Our course this semester will read these changes through three key concepts – revolution, democracy, and empire. Class discussion will seek to understand different meanings of these concepts, their political stakes, and ways of knowing how to move between political ideals and historical examples. Students will read a range of materials – from primary historical sources, to philosophic texts, political pamphlets and treatises, and travel journals – so as to study the effects on both the European context and beyond.

This course will examine these events, the political and ethical challenges they raised, and the intellectuals who shaped the ensuing public debates. It will draw on historical documents, cultural media (e.g. posters, art, film), and philosophical texts to explore contemporary France in its century of politics and protest.  Thinkers range from film-maker Gillo Pontecorvo, to philosopher-playwright Jean-Paul Sartre, to philosopher Michel Foucault.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Fall & Spring"
"POL","3272","Colonial Encounters","Twin Cities","If politics classically is the exercise of power by rulers over the ruled, how have different communities, traditions, and contexts sought to organize this power and render it just?  What are the lessons to be learned from looking to past experiences with political communities ranging in size from the face-to-face polis to the far-flung reaches of empire? How does the ‘discovery’ of other societies disorient our usual frames of reference for thinking about political community? What different frames might we use? What should we make of problems that seem to exceed the capacity of existing institutions to manage, such as mass violence and total war? 

The aim of this course is to examine exemplary moments that consider the radical conflict of interpretations that can arise when different cultures come into contact with one another (whether through trade, war, intellectual exchange, or the like), and how these exchanges transform the scale of political community (local, regional, global, universal). Here, we are concerned with large-scale upheaval, processes that are more than simply difficult political problems, but in fact transform the very institutions, relationships, and concepts through which we come to understand what political community is and can be. The substantive focus of the course varies according to instructor, and may include: Colonial Encounters; the Black Atlantic; Revolutionary Moments; Colonialism and the Post-colony.

In this course, History of Nordic Cinema, we will survey discrete moments in Nordic film history (viewing films from Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden) and contextualize them within broader developments in global cinema. Particularly important in this regard will be Nordic Cinema's love-hate relationship with Hollywood and its complicated status as European Cinema. We will begin in the beginning, with examples of Scandinavia's often-underestimated role as an international, artistic, and popular culture powerhouse in the silent era up through WWI. We'll go on to explore Nordic film productions intended mainly for domestic audiences and juxtapose these with the emergence of a compelling modernist, art-house cinema tradition revolving around the international figure of the auteur director, including Ingmar Bergman and later, Aki Kaurismäki. We'll consider examples of 60s and 70s political, avant-garde cinema (reverberations of the French Nouvelle Vague); talk about the unique development of state-funded structures for film production in these small countries; and end with a survey of recent Nordic films and movements such as Dogme 95 that illustrates ways in which small national cinemas continue to grapple with new iterations of globalization.

Theatrical performance reflects, resists, and rewrites culture; it can (and does) perform the political by reimagining and transforming society. Through exciting examples of plays and productions from around the world, we investigate the history, politics, and aesthetics of theatre. We explore how the different components of theatre (from directing to acting, costume, and lighting design) come together to create powerful impact on stage. We read and discuss plays in class, see performances on stage, and hear from some of the Twin Cities’s most dynamic and committed artists. And we work on valuable writing skills that help us to deepen our understanding of theatre and communicate our insights to others. At the end of the class, we bring together everything we have been learning to make theatre in small groups. No previous theatre experience is needed.

"TH","1102","Stage, Screen, Society: Performance in the Media Age","Twin Cities","From viral memes to ‘fake news,’ from video-gaming to vlogging, our rapidly changing media-scape is at the center of public debates about everything from mental health to the future of democracy. This course engages with these debates to understand the power of new media to shape our identities and values, our cultural habits and communities, our economy and political life. We discuss how we “perform ourselves” through media, giving rise to social anxieties about truth, authenticity, equality, and belonging, but also to tremendous opportunities for self-expression and connection. And we investigate how our performances are monetized or instrumentalized by governments, social movements, or corporations. How did our current media system develop, and whose interests has it served? How, for better or worse, has the social media age changed us and the world we live in? And how can we make sure that in the future that change is for the better?","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Fall"
"WRIT","3244W","Critical Literacies: How Words Change the World","Twin Cities","This course is focused on understanding and using the insights into language and writing that animate Critical Literacy movements in the United States. Literacy is usually thought of in terms of fundamental abilities to read and write about a reality outside of language. Critical Literacy is an intellectual and social movement that challenges this dominant understanding of literacy. Critical Literacy’s fundamental claim is that texts (and our practices for working with them) invite readers (and writers) to accept particular versions of reality as the Real Truth.  Through historical and contemporary models, students will learn how efforts to question and transform dominant ways of using language have played an especially important role in struggles for greater justice by and for oppressed groups. Here, people have used the ideas and methods of Critical Literacy to question how racial, gender, social class, and other privileges structure our language practices and our daily experiences. Students will be invited to apply a critical understanding of literacy to their own writing as they analyze course texts and produce original essays on topics of interest to them.","3","3","No","1","3","AFV - A-F or Audit","000595","Every Spring"
"WRIT","3315","Writing on Issues of Land and the Environment","Twin Cities","This course explores how written texts help shape understandings of the land in the U.S. Students read and analyze historical texts that have contributed to colonialist understandings of nature and the land. Students will study how the rhetorical strategies of such texts helped to form exploitive relations with the land and enact violence against indigenous peoples. Historical and current texts written by native peoples provide a counter-narrative to the myth of progress. Emphasis in the course is placed on analyzing texts with an eye toward setting the ground for conversations aimed at achieving sustainability and justice. Students will also study how written texts are composed within material contexts that contribute to their understanding.","3","3","No","1","3","AFV - A-F or Audit","000595","Every Spring"
"WRIT","3381W","Writing and Modern Cultural Movements","Twin Cities","This course explores how written texts help to shape modern art and cultural movements. Writ 3381 first develops an understanding of the manifesto form by reading primary examples written by artists from such movements as Cubism and Expressionism.  Students study the complex written and visual strategies of those texts and how they contributed to social and political change in the modern world. Out of those attempts to change culture, students will be challenged to consider how particular writing strategies developed in the U.S. aimed at bringing about change in 1960s culture in areas such as the women's movement, the move toward racial equality, and the environmental movement. Toward the end of the course, the writings of current movements are taken up as building on and departing from past writing and rhetorical strategies. Students both read about and practice writing strategies studied in the course.","3","3","No","1","3","AFV - A-F or Audit","000595","Every Fall"
