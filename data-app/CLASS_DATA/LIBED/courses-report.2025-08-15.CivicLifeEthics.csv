"AMES","3671","Hinduism and the Making of Modern India","Twin Cities","This course explores the role that Hinduism has played in Indian culture and politics the late 18th c. to the present, and the way that Hinduism itself has been transformed during this period.  In this course, we shall be guided by five overarching questions:
•	What are the key texts and everyday ritual practices of Hinduism, and how have these changed over the course of the last two centuries?  
•	What is the changing place of caste and especially the practice of untouchability in the understanding of what means to be a Hindu?  
•	What role do concerns about the role of women play in the religious reform movements and the emergence of new Hindu identities? 
•	What is the political role played by visions of Hinduism at and in different historical developments?  
By weaving together an analytical narrative centered around these four questions, we shall trace the remaking of Hinduism as a modern religion—one that wrestles with questions around nationalism, the public-private divide, the meaning of worship in a secular society, the relation with other religions, and equality of co-religionists.

"BIOL","1012","Human Biology: Concepts and Current Ethical Issues","Twin Cities","One semester exploration of human anatomy and physiology within the context of ethics; topics such as human genetic diversity, organs and tissues, disease and reproduction. Weekly policy debates.  Active learning format. Animal dissections required. Suitable for students in any major. Must be taken in addition to BIOL 1009 to fulfill prerequisites for allied health grad programs.

This course explores several interdisciplinary questions, each of which addresses biology through an ethical and societal lens.  In “What makes humans unique?”, we will consider the evolution of human traits, how the concept of race relates to human genetic diversity, and the fallibility of human memories.  In “How does blood and organ donation work?”, we will examine how our bodies can recognize and respond to foreign materials, how vaccines work, and who should have access to life saving tissue and organ transplants.  In “How do stress, diet and exercise affect health?” ,we will consider disparities in access to adequate nutrition, exposure to stress, and exercise, and how these affect our bodies and our mental health.  Lastly, in “How does a unique individual develop from a single cell”, we will examine how a single cell develops into a fully functional human being, and how similar processes lead to cancer. We will also consider the role of genes and hormones in human reproduction and the development of reproductive structures in embryos, while explicitly addressing the ethics of the distinctions between the concepts of sex characteristics, sex assigned at birth, and gender. We will learn how a cell can become cancerous, as well as how a cell develops into a fully functioning human being.  Additionally, we will consider the role of hormones in the development of male, female, and intersex organs, while being explicit about the differences between gender, sexual orientation, and sex assigned at birth.  

In lecture, instructors and teaching assistants will support students as they evaluate data and work through concepts in teams. Students will also dedicate significant time to the consideration of ethical questions in human biology, and work with teammates to organize and present a position on a policy related to an ethics question. In lab, students will further explore human anatomy and physiology, connecting structure and function through several dissections and activities. Students will read and share scientific papers, make observations, design experiments and analyze data.  Students will work in teams to complete a multi-week project on the physiology of stress. We will continue our exploration of ethics topics in lab, where we will discuss and apply ethics in human subjects research and research on non-human animals.  

About ⅓ of the course grade will be based on four traditional lecture exams and a final lab exam. The remainder of the course grade is comprised of open notes quizzes, in class team assignments, individual assignments, and team projects. Course grading is based on mastery of concepts and skills, and students are encouraged to collaborate in understanding course material.","4","4","No","1","4","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Fall & Spring"

By drawing attention to the ethical concept of relational being, through which individual humanity is both grasped and sustained, students will reflect on their ethical responsibilities to analyze and change U.S. educational systems. Students will investigate institutional and social constraints on equitable educational opportunities for Chicano/Latino students by exploring models for decolonizing education through civic action.

To fulfill the service-learning component of this course, (outside of class time) students will tutor and mentor Chicanos/Latinos at El Colegio or Academia Cesar Chavez as well as dialogue with Chicano/Latino educators and advocates. Generally, students will work 2-3 hours per week with one of these two partners.

"ENGL","3071","The American Food Revolution in Literature and Television","Twin Cities","America's relationship with food and eating has changed profoundly over the last fifty years. At the heart of this revolution was a group of charismatic personalities who through writing and television brought first European and then global sensibilities to the American table. They persuaded Americans that food and cooking were not just about nutrition but also forms of pleasure, entertainment, and art; ways of exploring other cultures; and means of declaring, discovering, or creating identity. Their work would eventually transform the American landscape, helping give rise to the organic movement, farmers markets, locavorism, and American cuisine, as well as celebrity chefs, the Food Network, and restaurant reality television. In the meantime, the environmental movement was sending its own shockwaves through American consciousness of food production and consumption. The joining together of these movements--culinary and environmental--has brought a new ethical dimension to the subject that is now at the forefront of current concerns about American food. Insofar as we eat, we necessarily make choices that have profound implications for our health, our communities, the environment, and those who work in the food industry, broadly defined. This class will trace the American food revolution with the intent of understanding how our current system came to be and thinking through the ethical implications of our daily actions. We will read classic literature from the rise of the movement, in varying degrees instructional, personal and documentary, while viewing some seminal television moments for the food culture we now know. We will give particular attention to recent work that focuses on the personal and environmental ethics of food.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Fall"

"ENGL","3506","Social Movements & Community Education","Twin Cities","In this course, we'll examine four progressive social movements. After beginning with a foundational civil rights movement example, we will learn about the anti-racist feminism branch of the women's movement, often referred to as ""third-wave feminism."" We'll also study the Occupy movement that arose in response to the Great Recession (the financial crisis beginning in 2008). Then we'll take a look at two social movements that, while by no means underground, tend to fly below the radar: the prison abolition movement and the fight for public schools. While all of these social movements have different emphases, they also overlap quite a bit in their systemic analysis of society and their strategies for action. As activist, organizer, and trainer Rinku Sen observes, ""the history of community organizing and social movements is replete with tactics learned in one movement being applied to another.""

As we study these social movements, community organizing will be of particular interest to us. How do the groups, collectives, nonprofits, and communities propelling these different social movements organize themselves, their leadership, their strategies, and their activities? How do they make decisions? What do meetings and planning processes look like? What do they do when they disagree? How do they recruit and mobilize? How do they communicate with and confront the general public, elected officials, and the more powerful elements of the ruling class? How do they talk about the work they're doing?  How do they develop a vision of the world they'd like to live in while still inhabiting the present one, with all its flaws and injustices? We'll also examine the role of education in organizations working for social change. Whether through trainings, ""political education,"" reading groups, or small group activities associated with popular education, many of the social-movement groups we'll study have developed educational strategies and curricula.  

Hands-On Learning through Community Education: As we study these social movements and their approaches to organizing and educating in the comfortable confines of our university classroom, we'll also learn about them experientially through our service-learning. That is, we'll work 2 hours per week at local education initiatives in K-12 schools, adult programs, and social-justice organizations in the non-profit and grassroots sectors, comprising a total of 24 hours by the end of the semester. This hands-on learning will strengthen our academic grasp of social movements, organizational dynamics, and teaching and community organizing by providing us with grounded perspectives. More broadly, we'll get a feel for what it's like to get involved as citizens, activists, teachers, and learners attempting to build cross-organizational coalitions. And we'll share what we learn with each other.

Representatives from the Center for Community-Engaged Learning (the U's service-learning office) and various community organizations will attend our second class session to tell you about their respective sites and how you can get involved. For our third class session, you will rank the top three community sites you'd like to work at. You will then be ""matched"" with a community organization, and your community education work will begin as soon as this matching process is complete. (We try to honor students' first and second choices, while also making sure that you also have some fellow classmates at your site.) To help prepare you, at a time convenient for you, you will also attend a training session facilitated by the Minnesota Literacy Council (MLC) or the Center for Community-Engaged Learning-- details will be provided in class.

"ENGL","4233","Modern and Contemporary Drama","Twin Cities","Why did the polite Danish homes of 1879 bar discussions of Henrik Ibsen’s A Doll’s House? How did Oscar Wilde surreptitiously signal his sexuality through a satire of Victorian seriousness in The Importance of Being Earnest? How do contemporary playwrights such as August Wilson or Lynn Nottage bring forgotten moments of African American history to light? This course shows how modern and contemporary theater presents original perspectives on human identities and relationships as well as encourages audiences to see the world in new ways. This course focuses on the close analysis and interpretation of plays written by dramatists from around the world from the late-nineteenth to the twenty-first century. The plays we will study are set in Europe, Great Britain, North America, Africa, and Asia, and we will examine each carefully in light of the unique historical and social contexts in which they were produced, their creation and uses of aesthetic form, and their impact on individuals and communities.

Through the course, you will become familiar with such dramatic forms as the well-made play, modern satire, realism, expressionism, symbolism, epic theater, and absurdism. Each of these is interesting not only as a distinctive mode of artistic  presentation, but also as it offers different perspectives on historical moments and present-day concerns about people and their communities. Theatrical works illustrate how the meanings ascribed to physical bodies are at the heart of social differences such as gender, sexuality, class, race, disability, and national identity. We will look at each play in its original cultural context as well as through the creative lens of more recent productions and assess how both historical and more recent reimagining changes the meaning of the work. We will also make use of the rich theatrical resources and cultural organizations available in communities such as the Twin Cities.

Did you know these are in part insect related questions? Insects make up more than half of the living organisms on this planet, and they have had a profound impact in shaping human society and culture. Even so, insects are swatted, stomped, squished, and otherwise misunderstood. In this course students will explore the complex, and often uncomfortable, relationships between insects and humans and explore the ethical dilemmas posed by our close relationships with the insect world. Ultimately this course examines the interactions between insects and humans, focusing on contemporary topics that explore how insects dictate human actions, policies, and behaviors. Topics include: human perception of insects; basic concepts in insect biology and behavior; environmental and cultural importance of insects; the role of insect pests in determining human food choice; insect vectors and disease transmission; perception and awareness about humanity’s role in nature.","3","3","No","1","3","A-F - A-F Grade Basis","-","Every Fall"

"ESPM","3921","Science and Critical Thinking for Understanding Our World","Twin Cities","Today more than ever we must deal with multiple sources of conflicting information on topics that affect our lives in big ways.  We use this information to make important decisions, from major policy decisions to personal lifestyle choices. Understanding complex, high-stakes societal issues such as the global COVID-19 pandemic requires that we rapidly process and synthesize new science that is changing fast, and that we do so in an environment of partisan bias and media spin that make it extremely difficult for citizens to stay informed and make good decisions. The debate surrounding the response to COVID-19, climate change, water policy, and other planetary and human health issues, invoke moral or ethical principles in addition to scientific arguments. As a result, problem solving and decision making requires simultaneously evaluating complex scientific and ethical arguments. Several aspects of human psychology mean that we do not reliably make logical choices when presented with complex information. Furthermore, data and science are frequently used to mislead, from the naïve misuse of statistics to deliberate misinformation campaigns. As a result, weighing evidence and rational decision-making for complex issues requires skepticism, critical thinking, and lots of practice. 

In this course, students will develop critical thinking tools and cultivate scientific skepticism for evaluating claims encountered in peer-reviewed scientific papers, popular press articles, or on social media. Examples and case studies will draw heavily on current events surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and associated societal and environmental responses,  but will also include other environmental, health, and public policy issues to demonstrate the range of ways in which data and science can be used or misused to support a position. To create the necessary habits of mind for skepticism and critical thinking, this course will cover background material from ethics, neurology, behavioral economics, statistics, and logic. We will employ a number of active learning strategies, and class meetings will frequently consist of students actively engaged in processing and understanding course content. 

Upon leaving this course students will be able to confidently evaluate the veracity of information as they encounter it in multiple contexts throughout their lives. Students will understand how views of the role of ethics in scientific inquiry have evolved, and the roles of science, uncertainty, and ethics in determining public opinion and policy decisions on environmental topics. Students will learn to identify and recognize misinformation in its various forms and to articulate why a particular piece of information is misleading. We will explore the various ways that our intuition and memory make interpreting data and statistics challenging, and develop tools and habits of mind to overcome these challenges.","3","3","No","1","3","A-F - A-F Grade Basis","-","Every Fall"

"FRIT","3656","Existentialism","Twin Cities","What do we mean when we call something ""existential?""  What do we mean when we speak of an ""existential"" crisis? We seem to mean that our core beliefs and assumptions are affected and the relationship with our environment is ruptured; we have fallen out of normalcy. The term existentialism -- turning existential into a noun -- came into being in the 1940s in France, reflecting the collective experience of societal breakdown, of Nazism, and WW2. It has since been applied to all modes of philosophical inquiry that take an individual's experience of alienation from society as their point of departure. The advantage of making alienation the focus of this class, too, is that it allows us to recognize the precise historical and sociological index of the emergence of an existentialist mode of thought and practice. Existentialism looks very different when it responds to a 19th century crisis of faith (Søren Kierkegaard), to 1950s colonialism (Frantz Fanon), to Weimar Germany's new democracy and the specter of a mass society (Martin Heidegger), or to the neo-authoritarian French society of the 1960s (Simone de Beauvoir). Existentialism then is understood in this class not as a conversation between great thinkers or ideas across time and space, but as a response to a specific crisis of norms and values. It only exists in plural. If existentialist concepts -- like being-in-the world, being-towards-death, or the gaze of the other -- are carried forward, then not without being repurposed. Such situatedness is inherent to existentialism itself. Accordingly, existentialist writers have no creed or ethical stance in common; they are found both on the far (fascist) right and on the Marxist left. They do share though a keen interest in a new language and in literary forms of expression and subsequently, they insist on the individuals' capacity of ""world-making"" -- in rupture and rebellion -- against seemingly compromised societal norms.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Spring Even Year"
"FSCN","1013","Dietary Supplements: scientific, regulatory, and cultural aspects","Twin Cities","Dietary supplements are commonplace in modern life, especially in the United States, furthermore the dietary supplement industry is a multi billion dollar industry with relatively little government oversight and regulation. Many factors have spurred the use of dietary supplements such as changes in dietary patterns, growing focus on preventative healthcare, marketing & social media (e.g., celebrity and athletic endorsements & consumer anecdotes), and increased accessibility through e-commerce, but there has been little philosophical work on the ethical issues surrounding these. This course is designed to encourage students to critically examine and reflect on these factors as well as dietary supplement use across cultures and the appropriation of traditional medicines and knowledge for commercial gains. Students will also evaluate information on dietary supplements for performance, strength, weight loss, and the treatment of diseases or delay of disease onset and assess the ethical decision making related to the marketing and use of supplements for these purposes.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Spring"

Is it possible to live sustainably, as individuals and societies, in what scientists are calling the Anthropocene, or this new epoch of human influence over the planet? Will sustainability require that we sacrifice the gains humanity has made in our quality of life? Or can we find a way to create a good Anthropocene? This course will attempt to answer these questions in four ways:
1. By providing an overview of sustainability science, both what it says about about human and natural systems and how it comes to make these claims
2. By examining various conceptions of the good life, both individual and social, and how they intersect with the findings of sustainability science 
3. By exploring the conflicts that exist within and between differing visions of sustainability and the good life through case studies in energy, water, and food
4. By pursuing collaborative research projects that will help students apply their knowledge and skills to current problems in sustainability studies
We will read widely in the sciences, social sciences, and humanities to understand a range of historical and contemporary perspectives on these questions, and in doing so we will put abstract ethical principles into conversation with a diversity of specific cultures and environments. By the end of the course, students will have examined their own assumptions about personal and professional happiness, considered how these align with and diverge from societal visions and values, and explored innovative solutions to help sustain our productive economy and our planet.

"GCC","3029","Agents of Change: scientific and philosophical perspectives","Twin Cities","Grand challenges like structural racism, climate change, gender oppression, and global poverty have to be solved by individual people, acting together, often through institutions. This means that we need good agents of change to address the challenges we face.  What does it mean to be a ‘good agent’?  What are the best ways to think about this kind of agency? And how can we foster more of it in ourselves, our friends, our children, and our fellow citizens? 

This course is taught by a philosopher and a psychologist, and we approach questions like these from both perspectives. Traditionally, many philosophers have thought that we need to cultivate virtues such as compassion and open-mindedness in order to be good people. Some recent psychological work casts doubt on this picture: the social and environmental forces that influence our behavior cannot be overcome with virtuous character! On the other hand, psychological research also shows that some of the good traits we have are ones that develop reliably, from early childhood. Which perspective offers more opportunities for progress? Should we foster good agency by working on individual character or by changing social circumstances? Or, if both are important, what would a combined approach look like? 

The ultimate goal of the course is to encourage students to apply the theoretical and scientific ideas about improving agency to specific grand challenges. How do philosophy and psychology help us to define and resolve the challenges that confront people who want to make a difference? To provide a model for this kind of research, we focus on structural racism and white supremacy to expose the ways in which individual and structural forces can impede epistemic and moral agency.

"GCC","5029","Agents of Change: scientific and philosophical perspectives","Twin Cities","Grand challenges like structural racism, climate change, gender oppression, and global poverty have to be solved by individual people, acting together, often through institutions. This means that we need good agents of change to address the challenges we face.  What does it mean to be a ‘good agent’?  What are the best ways to think about this kind of agency? And how can we foster more of it in ourselves, our friends, our children, and our fellow citizens? 

This course is taught by a philosopher and a psychologist, and we approach questions like these from both perspectives. Traditionally, many philosophers have thought that we need to cultivate virtues such as compassion and open-mindedness in order to be good people. Some recent psychological work casts doubt on this picture: the social and environmental forces that influence our behavior cannot be overcome with virtuous character! On the other hand, psychological research also shows that some of the good traits we have are ones that develop reliably, from early childhood.

One of the largest industries, tourism, is in a profound crisis. This course understands tourism in relation to other kinds of mobility, like shopping, colonialism, trafficking, migration, and pilgrimage. As the negative environmental and health impacts of tourism have become obvious, significant demands have emerged on its practices and policies. Investigating the landscapes and economies of cars, planes, beaches, parks, malls, and museums, we come to appreciate the unique challenges tourism poses for global citizenship and the planet. To gain a critical geographical understanding of mobility, we engage a range of ethical frameworks such as human rights, feminism, social justice, and utilitarianism.

The emphasis is on practice, on seeing one's own life as something to be enriched by seeing and feeling the world in new ways. Students will encounter a mix of philosophical works, artistic texts (novels, films, poetry,  painting, music, and other forms of media) and scholarly texts that together will help students expand their ingrained and conditioned ways of seeing the world. Class themes might include self and other, community and alienation, place and placelessness, home and homelessness.

"GSD","3656","Existentialism","Twin Cities","What do we mean when we call something ""existential?""  What do we mean when we speak of an ""existential"" crisis? We seem to mean that our core beliefs and assumptions are affected and the relationship with our environment is ruptured; we have fallen out of normalcy. The term existentialism -- turning existential into a noun -- came into being in the 1940s in France, reflecting the collective experience of societal breakdown, of Nazism, and WW2. It has since been applied to all modes of philosophical inquiry that take an individual's experience of alienation from society as their point of departure. The advantage of making alienation the focus of this class, too, is that it allows us to recognize the precise historical and sociological index of the emergence of an existentialist mode of thought and practice. Existentialism looks very different when it responds to a 19th century crisis of faith (Søren Kierkegaard), to 1950s colonialism (Frantz Fanon), to Weimar Germany's new democracy and the specter of a mass society (Martin Heidegger), or to the neo-authoritarian French society of the 1960s (Simone de Beauvoir). Existentialism then is understood in this class not as a conversation between great thinkers or ideas across time and space, but as a response to a specific crisis of norms and values. It only exists in plural. If existentialist concepts -- like being-in-the world, being-towards-death, or the gaze of the other -- are carried forward, then not without being repurposed. Such situatedness is inherent to existentialism itself. Accordingly, existentialist writers have no creed or ethical stance in common; they are found both on the far (fascist) right and on the Marxist left. They do share though a keen interest in a new language and in literary forms of expression and subsequently, they insist on the individuals' capacity of ""world-making"" -- in rupture and rebellion -- against seemingly compromised societal norms.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Spring Even Year"

•	What are the key texts and everyday ritual practices of Hinduism, and how have these changed over the course of the last two centuries?  
•	What is the changing place of caste and especially the practice of untouchability in the understanding of what means to be a Hindu?  
•	What role do concerns about the role of women play in the religious reform movements and the emergence of new Hindu identities? 
•	What is the political role played by visions of Hinduism at and in different historical developments?  
By weaving together an analytical narrative centered around these four questions, we shall trace the remaking of Hinduism as a modern religion—one that wrestles with questions around nationalism, the public-private divide, the meaning of worship in a secular society, the relation with other religions, and equality of co-religionists.

Moving chronologically and from the global to the local, this class will first examine the complex and intertwined reasons that prompted people to settle (either temporally or permanently) in the U.S. in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. We will explore the communalities and differences between the Poles, Ukrainians, Germans, Czechs, Slovaks, Jews, Hungarians, Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs who made up this initial wave of migration, and assess how these migrants shaped the urban and social fabric both in the United States, and in St. Paul and Minneapolis. Second, the class will examine how these communities evolved over the course in the 20th century by a) exploring topics such as ethnic identity maintenance, inter-generational relations, return migration, xenophobia and antisemitism, the relationship between migrants and the host society, and institutions (churches and synagogues, fraternal organizations, learned societies, archives, museums and libraries, etc.) established by migrants in the U.S., and b) assessing the impacts of later migration waves from Europe to the U.S., caused by the Holocaust and the Second World War, the 1956 Hungarian uprising, the 1968 Prague Spring, Soviet emigration policies, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the civil wars in Yugoslavia. 

Keeping in mind the pressing ethical questions that subtend migration (both historical and contemporary), this class will also ask what it means to be a descendant of Central and Eastern European migrants in present-day Minnesota—not just of those who arrived over a century ago, but also more recent migrants, e.g., Russians, or Muslims from Bosnia-Hercegovina. To this end, we will enrich our classroom by extending it into the metro area with visits to relevant sites and meetings with representatives of some of these communities in order to understand their current lives, work, and challenges.

Exploring the Purpose and Value of American Higher Education","Twin Cities","Recent poll data suggests that many Americans are questioning the value of higher education. For example, 2/3 of those surveyed stated that colleges are stuck in the past and not meeting the needs of today’s students. What is the purpose of college? Should a 4-year degree be accessible to all? Does a college education lead to attaining the “good life?” In this interactive honors seminar, we will address these questions and more. Students will have the opportunity to examine their own objectives as it relates to pursuing higher education and explore important issues impacting higher education (e.g., student debt, access, and admissions). Students will engage in regular reading, writing, and discussion around critical issues in higher education. Small group interaction, presentations, media analysis (e.g., podcasts, films), and ongoing reflection will be features of this seminar. 

The course will be organized around three main units, each guided by a specific question that we will aim to address. Unit 1 will address the question “What is the history of higher education, and what are the reasons for pursuing a degree? Unit II explores: “What are key current topics in higher education that deserve exploration?” As a part of this unit, we will discuss trends and issues that address the mission of higher education, especially post-pandemic.

"HSEM","3025H","Food, Clothing, Shelter: The Culture and Politics of Simple Living","Twin Cities","At a time of rising income inequality, in which billionaires grow richer while millions struggle to survive, this course will examine the social, environmental, economic, and ethical aspects of consumption and poverty through the lens of three basic needs: food, clothing, and shelter. It seeks to help you answer three key questions: what should you eat, what should you wear, and where should you live, so that others might do the same. We will begin by exploring the theory and practice of simple living through three comparisons: the realities of social and environmental insecurity versus the ideals of Sustainable Development; voluntary simplicity as historically practiced by communities as opposed to individuals; and the movement for degrowth compared to business as usual. In the central portion of our course, we will consider several contemporary forms of simplicity that exist alongside the ""involuntary simplicity"" often dictated by poverty: cooking at home and eating lower on the food chain because it is virtuous rather than because it is cheaper; shopping in thrift stores and buying fewer clothes because you want to rather than because you have to; and camping and living the #vanlife because you can rather than because you must. In our exploration of simple living and basic needs, we will address major issues in sustainability studies, including the Anthropocene, decolonial approaches to economics, and effective altruism, and we will consider a range of literary and historical perspectives on food, fashion, and architecture, such as Henry David Thoreau's ""Walden,"" Marie Kondo's ""The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up,"" Sarah Susanka's ""The Not So Big House,"" and the films ""The True Cost,"" ""The Minimalists,"" and ""Nomadland."" Throughout our course we will also attempt to answer two big questions about simple living: Is it the ultimate embodiment of white, middle-class, leisure-based U.S. environmentalism, or is it part of a global, multicultural challenge to the racist and colonial foundations of capitalism? Does it express some profound truths about the human condition, or will it never be anything more than a niche response to the social and environmental challenges of the 21st century? Requirements will include attendance and participation, a series of short reading responses, several reflective writing assignments, and a final project exploring some aspect of our subject in greater depth.","3","3","No","1","3","A-F - A-F Grade Basis","000571","Periodic Fall"
"HSEM","3027H","What is a Tragedy?","Twin Cities","Fiction or real event, modern condition or historical myth, private drama or public catastrophe: the idea of “tragedy” has always had specific cultural meaning. The particularities of this meaning, however, do shift—according to cultural norms, political pressures, and social changes. This class will ask us to consider what “tragedy” means, from its original context in the dramatic genre, in which political regimes are shaken and often a good number of important people die (Sophocles’ Oedipus Rex cycle, Shakespeare's King Lear, Racine's Phèdre), to its appearance in novels, politics, current events, and contemporary theory. What happens when the notion of tragedy moves out of the ritualized space of the dramatic performance and into other languages, venues, and political arenas?  Is the death of a parent or a child a tragedy? To what extent is contemporary warfare a tragedy? Is food insecurity a tragedy? Is the tragic something we can know only in retrospect, and should we get better at “handling” it? Beginning with literature, this course will examine the components of the tragic, its role in our culture, and what its presence in discourse says about our moral landscape. Interventions from the medical field, bio-ethics, architecture, art history, media and film, anthropology, theater history and performance studies, communications and journalism, religious studies and more can be integrated into our program.

"PHIL","3009","Existentialism","Twin Cities","What do we mean when we call something ""existential?""  What do we mean when we speak of an ""existential"" crisis? We seem to mean that our core beliefs and assumptions are affected and the relationship with our environment is ruptured; we have fallen out of normalcy. The term existentialism -- turning existential into a noun -- came into being in the 1940s in France, reflecting the collective experience of societal breakdown, of Nazism, and WW2. It has since been applied to all modes of philosophical inquiry that take an individual's experience of alienation from society as their point of departure. The advantage of making alienation the focus of this class, too, is that it allows us to recognize the precise historical and sociological index of the emergence of an existentialist mode of thought and practice. Existentialism looks very different when it responds to a 19th century crisis of faith (Søren Kierkegaard), to 1950s colonialism (Frantz Fanon), to Weimar Germany's new democracy and the specter of a mass society (Martin Heidegger), or to the neo-authoritarian French society of the 1960s (Simone de Beauvoir). Existentialism then is understood in this class not as a conversation between great thinkers or ideas across time and space, but as a response to a specific crisis of norms and values. It only exists in plural. If existentialist concepts -- like being-in-the world, being-towards-death, or the gaze of the other -- are carried forward, then not without being repurposed. Such situatedness is inherent to existentialism itself. Accordingly, existentialist writers have no creed or ethical stance in common; they are found both on the far (fascist) right and on the Marxist left. They do share though a keen interest in a new language and in literary forms of expression and subsequently, they insist on the individuals' capacity of ""world-making"" -- in rupture and rebellion -- against seemingly compromised societal norms.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Spring Even Year"
"POL","1201","Political Ideas","Twin Cities","This course serves as an introduction to the study of political theory. Political theory analyzes the meaning and significance of fundamental concepts in politics. Starting from such basic concerns as the nature of politics, humans, power, and justice, political theorists explore how these basic starting assumptions organize the norms, practices, and institutions of political and social order. To explore these topics, the field turns to key texts, as well as to political and social events and other media (film, historical documents, etc.). In this introductory course, students will investigate some of the basic texts in political theory, with the goal of learning how to read texts more analytically and to address fundamental questions in political theory. Among the topics that might be the nature of justice and injustice, political obligation and civil disobedience, democracy and other forms of governance. Students who complete this course will understand the deep issues about the nature of politics and will have learned to read and analyze complex texts. They will also have had the opportunity to reflect upon their own ethical engagement in political life and upon the ways in which historically, political ideas change.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Fall, Spring & Summer"
"POL","3065","Political Engagement Careers: Planning and Preparing For Your Future","Twin Cities","Are you interested in pursuing a career in public service? Do you plan to run for office in the future, or work in a government agency (such as the State Department or the FBI or the MN DNR), or become a professional campaign manager or lobbyist, or work as an issue activist on a cause important to you? Would you like to learn more about the variety of public service careers open to a college graduate? Do you wonder what motivates people to pursue careers in politics, public administration, and community service, and how these motivations vary across career fields? Would you like to explore some options for future internship or service learning while at the University? Then this course is for you!

This course is the Political Science Department's introduction to careers in political and civic engagement. Through readings focused on theories about and case studies of political engagement, and on the ethics of politics and public service, numerous guest speakers with extensive experience as public service professionals, and a discussion-oriented class format, we will explore the meaning of public service and the main types of public service careers that you could pursue. We will think about the virtues and challenges associated with doing public service work, and how these differ across different types of jobs and venues for serving the public. Finally, you will acquire practical knowledge and skills related to the search for public service work opportunities, including how to write a resume and cover letter, how to conduct an informational interview, networking, and the job search and application process. Intended primarily for first- and second-year undergraduates, but open to students of any major at any point in their undergraduate program.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Spring"
"POL","3225","American Political Thought","Twin Cities","This course provides an introduction to several key periods and some of the leading concepts and debates in American political thought. It might also focus on a broader theme such as: conceptions of destiny, mission, and exceptionalism; arguments over economic development and inequality; or debates over government and corporate power. The course will begin with Puritan religious and political thought, tracing its secularization over time. Considerable attention will be paid to the ideas behind the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, such as the social contract and the right of resistance to civil authority, civic republicanism, and the founders’ new science of politics and government. The course will consider some if not all of the following: debates over slavery and emancipation, women’s rights, the rise of imperialism and nationalism, race and racism, and the rise of rule by public and private bureaucratic organizations, and the consequences of these developments for the possibility of continued individual liberty, equality, and justice. This course requires considerable reading of difficult texts. The ultimate goal of this course is for students to gain a deeper understanding of American political thought as a product of the country’s ever-evolving political discourse. prereq: Suggested prerequisite POL 1201","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Fall, Spring & Summer"
"POL","3265","Ideas and Protest in French Postwar Thought","Twin Cities","France witnessed a number of extraordinary events in the 20th century:  the carnage and trauma of World Wars I and II; the Vichy regimes collaboration with German Nazis; the general strike and student protests of the 1960s; the tensions prompted by anti-colonialism and later decolonization in North Africa; and the challenges of post-colonialism and racial politics. This course will examine these events, the political and ethical challenges they raised, and the intellectuals who shaped the ensuing public debates. It will draw on historical documents, cultural media (e.g. posters, art, film), and philosophical texts to explore contemporary France in its century of politics and protest.  Thinkers range from film-maker Gillo Pontecorvo, to philosopher-playwright Jean-Paul Sartre, to philosopher Michel Foucault.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Fall & Spring"
"POL","3272","Colonial Encounters","Twin Cities","If politics classically is the exercise of power by rulers over the ruled, how have different communities, traditions, and contexts sought to organize this power and render it just?  What are the lessons to be learned from looking to past experiences with political communities ranging in size from the face-to-face polis to the far-flung reaches of empire? How does the ‘discovery’ of other societies disorient our usual frames of reference for thinking about political community? What different frames might we use? What should we make of problems that seem to exceed the capacity of existing institutions to manage, such as mass violence and total war? 

The aim of this course is to examine exemplary moments that consider the radical conflict of interpretations that can arise when different cultures come into contact with one another (whether through trade, war, intellectual exchange, or the like), and how these exchanges transform the scale of political community (local, regional, global, universal). Here, we are concerned with large-scale upheaval, processes that are more than simply difficult political problems, but in fact transform the very institutions, relationships, and concepts through which we come to understand what political community is and can be. The substantive focus of the course varies according to instructor, and may include: Colonial Encounters; the Black Atlantic; Revolutionary Moments; Colonialism and the Post-colony.

"POL","3767","Political Psychology of Elite Behavior","Twin Cities","Why do some world leaders seek cooperation while others advocate war? Why do some Presidents effect major change while others are relegated to the dustbin of history? How does the personality of leaders affect how they behave in office? In this class, we will address questions like these by exploring the psychology of political elites, those members of society who wield outsized influence over political decisions. This outsized influence means that understanding how elites think is particularly important. It is also unusually difficult, leading some to argue that political psychology can play little role in understanding elite decision-making.

 

Students will exit the class having mastered a body of knowledge about elite decision-making and learned about the different approaches that scholars take to study these decisions. They will also gain the critical capacity to judge arguments about politics, the ability to identify, define, and solve problems, and the skill to locate and critically evaluate information relevant to these tasks. Finally, this course takes a cooperative approach to learning, and many course activities will be structured around learning and working with a group of fellow students over the course of the semester. This course fulfills the Civic Life and Ethics theme requirement.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Fall Odd, Spring Even Year"
"POL","4267","Imperialism and Modern Political Thought","Twin Cities","How has political theory been shaped by imperialism? We will investigate this question through a study of such key thinkers as Kant, Mill, Marx, Lenin, Césaire, Fanon, and Gandhi, reading them through the lens of empire. Our goal is to analyze how such thinkers reflected upon, problematized and, at times, justified forms of Western imperialism. We will look at their explicit reflections on empire, as well as more tangential or ostensibly separate themes that may have only been shaped by the imperial context in indirect ways. Finally, we will reflect upon our contemporary location as readers and agents situated in the wake of these political and intellectual developments, analyzed through the question of what it means to engage in anti-colonial, decolonial, and/or postcolonial critique. This course will combine lectures by the professor with student-led seminar discussion.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Periodic Fall & Spring"
"RELS","3671","Hinduism and the Making of Modern India","Twin Cities","This course explores the role that Hinduism has played in Indian culture and politics the late 18 th c. to the present, and the way that Hinduism itself has been transformed during this period. In this course, we shall be guided by five overarching questions.
•	What are the key texts and everyday ritual practices of Hinduism, and how have these changed over the course of the last two centuries?  
•	What is the changing place of caste and especially the practice of untouchability in the understanding of what means to be a Hindu?  
•	What role do concerns about the role of women play in the religious reform movements and the emergence of new Hindu identities? 
•	What is the political role played by visions of Hinduism at and in different historical developments?  
By weaving together an analytical narrative centered around these four questions, we shall trace the remaking of Hinduism as a modern religion—one that wrestles with questions around nationalism, the public-private divide, the meaning of worship in a secular society, the relation with other religions, and equality of  co-religionists.

Students will experience firsthand many issues that directly affect the migrant journey and meet with many immigrants to hear their personal stories. In addition to learning the history of the situation on the border, students will take a tour of the border wall, visit neighboring communities that work with immigrants, do a legal immigration simulation, walk the migrant trails in the Sonoran Desert and leave water there with Humane Borders, go to a Operation Streamline Deportation Court hearing, visit migrants seeking political asylum in Florence Detention Center, talk with a leader in Southside Workers Center, meet with an author focusing on Border Patrol, and more.

Themes explored in this course include the connection between the roots of emigration and the global economy of violence in Central America; human rights on the border; and issues immigrants face in the US such as immigrants living in the US with or without legal documents, detention and deportation and the work they are doing to make a more just immigration system.

This course engages with these debates to understand the power of new media to shape our identities and values, our cultural habits and communities, our economy and political life. We discuss how we “perform ourselves” through media, giving rise to social anxieties about truth, authenticity, equality, and belonging, but also to tremendous opportunities for self-expression and connection. And we investigate how our performances are monetized or instrumentalized by governments, social movements, or corporations. How did our current media system develop, and whose interests has it served? How, for better or worse, has the social media age changed us and the world we live in? And how can we make sure that in the future that change is for the better?","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Fall"
"YOST","1001","Seeing Youth, Thinking Youth: Media, Popular Media, and Scholarship","Twin Cities","This course is an invitation to meet and engage with the field of Youth Studies. This is an introductory course to a subject you already know about – you’ve lived its content; thought about it; you may even written poems, made a video or posted a meme about this life-moment. Since you know this so well, why take a university course on it? You will leave this course better able to notice the young people around you; wonder about them and their lives; name, describe and analyze what you see and hear and read about youth. This course is about all young people. This means that we are attentive to including material about youth from diverse backgrounds, many ethnic/racial, social class, linguistic, and geographic locations or those who have a variety of physical and mental capacities, those who are “normal” and “typical” and those who are “not”. Together, we will examine myths and stereotypes about youth, where they come from, and how to deconstruct them using a variety of lenses-- social, popular and news media, young adult novels, academic articles, biographies, and more. We will do this through engaging class discussions and activities. You will learn how to use critical ethnography “in the field” where you will observe and write about youth in a variety of settings including malls, sporting events, busses, coffee shops, and music venues. We believe that an introductory college course is a space and time to reflect, analyze, and learn about what matters to you, about who you are and about the work others have done and what you want to do. In these ways, this course introduces ways of being an engaged and thoughtful student, citizen and professional, all of which require critical thinking skills and an ability to work across difference and diversity. In this course, students will develop skills in assessment, reflection/reflexivity, deconstruction, empathy and judgement; all precursors for professional decision-making in careers like youth work, policy, public health, education, communications, and other fields. We hope this course may lead to reflecting on your occupational future and vocational call.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Fall & Spring"
