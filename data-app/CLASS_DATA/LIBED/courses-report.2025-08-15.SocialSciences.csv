"AAS","1101","Imagining Asian America","Twin Cities","What are the histories, cultures, and experiences of Asian Americans, the fastest-growing group in the United States? How do they fit into the U.S.'s history of immigration, race, and citizenship? Is the ""model minority"" myth really true? This course is an introduction to Asian American Studies, an interdisciplinary field that uses ethnography, literature, histories, films, memoirs, and other texts to study how the history of Asian immigration to the United States has visibly shaped existing Asian American communities and identities, and how ""Asian America"" is central to a more general understanding of American popular culture and public life.

The course is roughly organized chronologically. We will first begin with an introduction to the field of Asian American Studies by asking the questions: What is Asian America? What is Asian American Studies? We will then examine important concepts, categories, and processes before exploring the rich history of Asian migration to the United States and contemporary issues facing Asian Americans today. 

One of the core principles of this course is to encourage active and interdisciplinary learning. This means that we will be learning in a variety of ways to explore and understand the material (reading, writing, watching, listening, seeing, discussing, presenting). We will be drawing from a wide range of disciplines (history, law, sociology, education, cultural studies, psychology, etc.). And we will be using a variety of materials (memoir, scholarly articles, historical documents, government records, newspapers, films, photographs, popular culture, etc.) Your active participation in these activities is essential.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Fall"
"AAS","1201","Racial Formation and Transformation in the United States","Twin Cities","What does it take to discuss race seriously? An exploration of this question demands a counter-narrative, for our contemporary moment is such that a growing public opinion (1) casts America as a “raceless nation,” (2) interprets antiracism as “reverse racism,” and (3) embraces “diversity” to maintain the racial status quo. As a class, we will explore what it means to treat race as a social construct and also a central organizing principle shaping patterns of power and inequality. Talking about race is not easy to be sure; it engenders a host of unsettling emotions ranging from guilt and shame to anger. Yet not talking about race as a social fact in American life and culture merely reinforces the existing racial hierarchy. It forecloses opportunities to reach across boundaries of social difference to strive toward a shared sense of community and belonging. Together, we will participate in racial struggles, albeit at times painful and challenging, to address and grapple with ethical-political imperatives to pursue social justice and make the notion of diversity anew. Together we will reckon with the role of institutions in conditioning the material realities of racialized groups, while also recognizing the capacity of racialized groups to resist regimes of racial power.","3","3","No","1","3","A-F - A-F Grade Basis","-","Periodic Fall & Spring"

‘Food Sovereignty in Africa’ critically evaluates how the physical environment and historical processes  shaped agricultural productivity in Africa, as well as exploring the subsequent relationship the  continent has had with the rest of the world. The course uses multi-disciplinary resources to examine historical factors that have contributed to contemporary food security issues, and discusses  grassroots food movements that embrace the ethics and values of African societies in their efforts to  achieve both food security and environmental sustainability. It also examines the interplay between  food security, indigenous knowledge, and environmental sustainability by comparing various  standpoints on African food production, scrutinizing the challenges the continent is facing and the  unique perspectives it offers in terms of agricultural development in the globalized world. Finally, the  course examines how agricultural systems in Africa are affected by the new global land rush.

These are the core questions that will guide our exploration of the political dynamics in the Horn of Africa. Just like most regions in Africa, the Horn is home to diverse cultures and languages. What distinguishes it, however, is the contested nature of state borders, which have been redrawn in ways not observed anywhere else in Africa since the end of European colonialism. The purpose of this class is to delve deeper into these conflicts, to examine the interactions between incumbent governments, armed rebel groups and international actors in shaping war and peace in the Horn. Throughout this journey, we will pay special attention to ideas of sovereignty, identity and violence and draw on literature outside of the Horn to help us better dissect what is going on within it.

Drawing on political organizing by women of color during the recent Black Lives Matter uprising, we consider what it means to make and claim space as women of color in politics.  We also look at how rage - BIPOC women's rage, white rage, rage against women - gets mobilized to cement and/or combat racism, xenophobia, and misogyny.  Finally, the course reframes women's rage as intrepid and redemptive, capable of sparking change during this political movement.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Periodic Fall & Spring"

"ANTH","3001","Introduction to Archaeology","Twin Cities","Archaeology is the study of humans in the past, primarily through the material remains they left behind. It seeks to answer fundamental questions, such as “When did humans first become dependent on fire?”, “What factors led to the development of agriculture?”, or “How can we explain the rise and fall of early civilizations?”  The study of each of these big questions relies on answering many small questions that are asked in the context of archaeological excavations and laboratory analyses.  A common theme underlies them: archaeology aims to reconstruct and understand why past human cultures changed.

The goal of this class is to provide an understanding of the methods and techniques used by archaeologists in their investigations.  It includes not only hands-on learning of specific analytical techniques, such as faunal and lithic analysis as well as site survey and excavation strategies, but also focuses on the theoretical approaches that guide the questions we ask and the methods we apply to answer them.  This class, therefore, prepares students for more upper-level classes in archaeology.  It also leads to a new way of thinking.  This way of thinking is primarily critical and analytical.  It leads one to think about how data are interpreted, and how theoretical frameworks as well as innate biases color these interpretations.  Seeking solutions to interpretive problems requires the creative application of multidisciplinary approaches.  Therefore, the study of archaeology leads to a new way of thinking about and doing science.","4","4","No","1","4","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Fall"

"GEOG","3101","Geography of the United States","Twin Cities","How do we understand the United States? Who are we as a nation? How did we get that way? This course takes a distinctly geographic approach to these questions, one that is interested in how socio-cultural, political-economic, and biophysical forces intersect in the shaping of America as a place. In this class, we will explore the kind of social and technological innovations and transformations that have made the American present. We will look at how the decisions of the past have shaped both the possibilities and problems of the present in order to help us grapple with the complexities of building the kinds of futures we want to live in. Rather than approaching this as an inevitable story of triumphant progress, we will pay attention to the erasures, exploitation, and violence that were part of these transformations. It is only through grappling with these complexities that we can work towards a future that works.

This course is designed for any student who is interested in making sense of the country we live in and feels invested in its future. Through the use of case studies, we will explore some of the essential issues facing modern America including immigration and sense of place, agriculture, and water in the Great Plains and the American West, and the intertwined future of American urbanism and the automobile industry as well as a few others. Students can expect to build skills in integrative thinking as they explore problems at the intersection of a variety of human and natural systems as well as an appreciation for how complexity shapes the production of and solution for contemporary socio-environmental problems.

The course’s journey begins with Islam’s dawn in the small desert oasis of Mecca in the Arabian peninsula over 14 centuries ago to today when it is a worldwide faith. One hundred years from its inception, Islam spread to what is today Syria, Iraq, the Horn of Africa, North Africa, and across the Mediterranean Sea. Central Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and Anatolia (Turkey) came under the sway of Islam leading to the emergence of three major Islamic civilization that dominated and enlightened the old world for several centuries. This era came to an end with the rise of Capitalist Europe and its colonization of much of the world including Muslim societies. Like many colonized peoples, Muslims threw the yoke of colonialism and joined the postcolonial World. Beyond this historical geographic survey, the course examines the Muslim World’s relationships with the West, democracy, and development. It will also explore how Muslim and Islam engage the seemingly contemporary topics such as human rights, gender relations, the monumental environmental crisis of our time, the war on terror and the terror of war, and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.

"GEOG","3331","Geography of the World Economy","Twin Cities","An invisible, not-quite-dead, not-quite-alive entity—the coronavirus—forced us, rudely and tragically, to reckon with space. As we try and maintain social distance from other bodies, wear masks to disrupt the virus’ pathways of diffusion, confront shortages in grocery stores, home supply outlets, and car dealerships, adjust to interruptions in many services, and either choose to, or are forced to stay at home, in our cities, in our countries, we are thinking and acting spatially. And we are reminded that “stuff”—food, medicines, toilet paper—reaches us often through geographically extensive and logistically intricate webs of economic production and distribution.

We will learn what it means to think geographically about the capitalist economy as a spatial, relational formation. In doing so, we will challenge dominant ways of understanding and analyzing the economy, and of what counts as economic. We will also examine two simultaneous aspects of the world economy—fixity and flow. On the one hand, the economy propels and is propelled by flows—of goods, of services, of people, of labor, and of finance. On the other hand, physical infrastructures are rooted in place on the earth. After all, even the digital worlds of Facebook, Google, and Amazon are enabled by vast server farms. The course will also highlight the production and proliferation of inequalities—between social groups, states, countries, and regions—in and by the world economy. In fact, we will ask: Is economic unevenness a mere byproduct of capitalist economic growth, or the condition of possibility for it? Finally, we will discuss the relationships between global phenomena and local events. Crises like global climate change, overflows of waste matter, COVID19, and the 2008 financial meltdown make it clear that the global and the local are intimately entangled. Not only do global events impact individual livelihoods, including yours and mine, but economic jitters in one place can escalate, sending shockwaves across the world.

This course examines how our world’s economic and political systems, and the livelihoods they engender in the Global South, have produced catastrophic local and global environmental conditions. What we produce, sell, buy, how we consume goods, and how we dispose of the waste are at the heart of the world’s deteriorating environmental conditions. The current global world order has produced a world in which overconsumption and poverty have led to an environmental disaster that is endangering all species. Example of the topics we will explore include the state of global fisheries and forests, the struggle over scarce water resources, and the responsibility each of us has as an individual and a citizen in reversing the lone planet’s ability to support the lives of all humans and other species.

"HMED","3325","Data, Death and Doctors: Hands-on Historical Health Research","Twin Cities","HMED 3325 is an applied introduction to historical medical demography: the study of who is sick or injured, and the type of treatments given, and what happens after treatment. The records created by health care workers give us important insights into how medical practice has changed over time, making the quantitative study of historical medical records central to the History of Medicine. We often ask two fundamental questions when examining medical records: “how bad is it?” and “what works?” In other words, what are the consequences of illness or injury, and how effective are medical interventions? These are questions that continue to be asked today in contemporary health and medicine, so the analytical techniques you learn in this class can be applied to modern data. Unlike modern health records whose access is restricted to protect people’s privacy, surviving historical health records can be used quite easily. 

This course will give you a hands-on experience in working with health data and researching the history of medicine. You will learn about different ways to collect and analyze data to effectively answer questions such as “what happened to people who were sick” and “did medical care help people?”—this is often called “causal inference”.  To do this effectively with historical medical records, we will read about how people in the past understood the illness or intervention we are studying. Understanding changes in the way people thought about illness and disease is another core part of the History of Medicine. To make sense of data, we need to know about how the people creating it understood the concepts they were measuring. This principle applies equally to modern data: effective data analysis requires us to understand what the numbers mean.

The class is structured to give you an overview of the research process from data collection to initial analyses. Working as a class we will collect a sample of historical health records from the University of Minnesota or Minnesota Historical Society archives giving you hands-on experience with archival research and designing social science databases. Through your readings for class and initial data exploration you will develop a research proposal, and then complete a small research project using the data we collected. At the completion of the course, you will have gained valuable experience in social science data analysis with real data and learned about how approaches to health, healing, and medicine have changed over time.","3","3","No","1","3","OPN - Student Option No Audit","-","Periodic Fall & Spring"

This class examines processes of racial formation in science, law, history, immigration policy, education, leisure, adoption, marriage, and medicine. The course investigates how Americans came to mythologize, understand, identify, and codify the importance of race since the mid-nineteenth century. Racial formations and classifications shift according to political climates, such that immigration debates, changing gender norms and concerns over interracial marriage transform how we imagine racial groups. We will also look at how race has been used to pathologize, eroticize, vilify, fetishize, and medicalize purported ‘problem people,’ like immigrants, the poor, and the sick. For instance, seeing people of color as particular hazards during pandemics, like the 1918 Influenza or 2020 COVID-19 crises, has deep roots in longstanding racial theories. Using memoirs, legal cases, history of medicine, laws, photographs, oral histories, and secondary source readings, this class traces the history of America’s fascination with race and how race came to define so many aspects of American life during the twentieth century.

"LING","1801","The Human Mind & Human Languages","Twin Cities","Our planet hosts around 7000 human languages. What do diverse languages across the world have in common and where exactly do they differ? What do these underlying similarities and differences between languages teach us about the human mind? How do linguistic knowledge and behavior differ across speakers of different languages and dialects of the same language, influenced by environmental and social variables such as class, ethnicity, and social identity? These big-picture questions will guide this course. One school of thought argues that all human beings are genetically born with the ability to learn and use complex patterns in language, and thus languages share many universal properties. Another school of thought believes in the concept of “embodied cognition,” or the idea that human language cannot express things that the human mind cannot experience. In this course, we directly study both schools of thought and various topics that highlight the vital mind and language connection. Topics of study will include:
- What role do language and cognition play in the development of thoughts?
- What are speech and language disorders in the brain?
- Why are color naming systems so diverse across languages?
- What are dialect continuums and isoglosses and how do they represent language variation across communities?
- What role does human memory play in efficiently computing the different orders of words and sentences in languages?
- Why are children so good at learning so many complexities of language, while adults are much slower?
- What aspects of the mind and language connection are being modeled in Artificial Intelligence?
- How are researchers using linguistics methodology to study other systems like music, dance, primate communication?
- How can linguistics and cognitive science be used to fight real world problems, such as misinformation? 

These and other topics will lead us into many modern-day innovations. One example of that is ChatGPT, which was trained on 911 billion words, the equivalent of about 1000 years of non-stop reading. Thus, ChatGPT, the best computer model, required 1000 years worth of training to learn how to have human-like speech, while actual humans can do it in a few short years! Innovations like these and many others show us that the relationship between human cognition and human languages is directly at the forefront of science today, and this relationship is our topic of study in this course.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Fall"
"LING","3001","Introduction to Linguistics","Twin Cities","The ability to acquire and use language is a biological trait of the human species.  This capacity for language manifests itself as thousands of particular languages spoken around the world in communities large and small. But what is language? What does it mean for a human to “know” a particular language? How do children acquire this knowledge? How do we use language to communicate? These are some of the important questions addressed by the field of linguistics, the scientific study of the human capacity for language in its physiological, cognitive, historical, and social manifestations.

This course introduces some of the essential findings of linguistics: first and foremost, that all varieties of all languages are intricately structured at multiple distinct but related levels. Second, that this intricate structure can be described in terms that are not only precise, but which apply to all human languages.  We will work to replicate some of these findings by deploying simple analytical methods on data from a variety of languages.  These methods allow us to answer questions about the different structural components of language: phonology (how do speech sounds pattern?), morphology (what are possible words and how are they built?), and syntax (what is the hierarchical structure underlying sequences of words?). In all instances these methods require that we pay attention to basic notions of semantics, from which more complex conceptions of meaning will emerge.

Having characterized language as an intricately-structured system of knowledge, we will then possess the tools to ask a number of additional questions about language and cognition. How does such complex knowledge play into the actual task of sentence production or comprehension? What do we know about the neural implementation of this knowledge in human brains? How does child language acquisition proceed, and what makes it so much more robust than language acquisition later in life? Do animals have languages of their own? Can they learn human languages?

Finally, we will turn our attention to variation in language patterns observed over the passage of time, across geographical space, and within social systems. How and why do languages change over historical time? What can we know about languages spoken before the invention of writing? What distinctions exist between languages spoken in different places, and how can we tell whether similarities are due to genealogical relationships? How do new languages emerge? How do languages disappear? How does language use vary between individuals from the same place or the same community? How do socioeconomic class, ethnicity, and gender relate to the linguistic behavior of individuals? How does language policy affect educational outcomes? What about social cohesion and conflict?

Although we will find that most of these questions lack definitive answers, we will develop an understanding of what it takes to ask them meaningfully and precisely. In particular, we will be able to eliminate false or misleading answers, especially when they fail to take into account the observable and describable properties of the human capacity for language.","4","4","No","1","4","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Fall, Spring & Summer"

Questions of power and choice, opportunity and discrimination, freedom and restrictions on freedom are fundamental to the historical development of and current controversies within the American political system, and we will attend to all of these. 

We will explore topics including the ideas underlying the nation’s founding and its constitutional foundations; civil rights and civil liberties; the role of the United States in an increasingly globalized world; the structure and function of American political institutions; and the behavior of American citizens in the political process. 

In addition, we will learn to think and communicate like political scientists.  We will read primary documents, such as the Federalist papers, engage with scholarly arguments about the way the American political system works, and critically evaluate critiques of the American political system that have been offered from a variety of perspectives. 

By the end of the semester students should have a basic understanding of the structure and function of American government as well as an increased ability to critically reflect on the degree to which our institutions, processes, and citizens live up to the expectations placed on them.  Students will be able to identify, define, and solve problems and to locate and critically evaluate information.  Students will have mastered a body of knowledge and a mode of inquiry.

"POL","1025","Global Politics","Twin Cities","Global politics is complex, fast-paced, and often confusing. This introductory course explores both the enduring challenges of international politics as well as more recent transformative trends. The course introduces theoretical traditions, but its focus is on making sense of real-world problems, both today and in the past. Why is the world organized into states, and what implications does the states system have for indigenous populations globally? Why and when do states go to war and use military force? Why do they sign international agreements and treaties, on matters from arms control to investment? In what ways do existing systems of international law and trade exacerbate or mitigate global inequities? Why has human rights emerged as a central problem in world politics? What are the prospects for international cooperation to address climate change? How have inequities and prejudices, along the lines of race and other categorical identities, shaped our world - from the practice of global security to the structures of the international political economy? These are among the pressing real-world questions that this course in Global Politics will address and that it will give you the tools to answer - though particular instructors will naturally emphasize different topics and questions. But the course will also highlight how our answers to these questions are changing along with the deep power structures of global politics - as US dominance wanes and others, most notably China, rise; as core ideas and discourses underpinning the international system, such as sovereignty, come under assault; as institutions, such as those governing international law, thicken; and as attention grows to the structuring effects of race and other ascriptive categories. Global Politics is an essential guide to our increasingly globalized world.","3","3","No","1","4","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Fall, Spring & Summer"
"POL","1054","Politics Around the World","Twin Cities","This course is an introduction to the study of politics in different countries around the world. It focuses on domestic politics within countries, as opposed to a course in international relations, which focuses on relations between countries. Some of the questions we tackle include: Why are some countries prone to violent conflict while others remain peaceful? Why do some countries grow rich while others remain poor? Why does democracy emerge in some countries, while dictators hold onto power elsewhere? How do attitudes about gender and sexuality influence politics? Do particular religions, or the strength of religious faith, strengthen or weaken democracy? The readings and assignments help you make sense of the complexity of world politics - to sift through and distill the avalanche of information available and learn how to develop your own arguments about pertinent global issues. 

Upon completion of this course you will be able to understand and provide examples of 1) the difference between strong and weak states; 2) the distinctions between democratic and non-democratic forms of government; 3) the various ways democracies are governed; 4) arguments explaining the origin of democracy and the persistence of non-democracy; 5) the significance of different forms of political identity such as ethnicity, religion, and gender; 6) why some countries are rich while others remain poor; and 7) why some countries tax and spend more than others. Assignments seek to develop your skills at developing arguments through logic and evidence and to give you the ability to distinguish between a persuasive argument about politics and simply stating an opinion.","3","3","No","1","4","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Fall, Spring & Summer"
"POL","3308","Congressional Politics and Institutions","Twin Cities","This course is an introduction to the politics of the U.S. Congress and the federal legislative process. Throughout the semester, we will focus on the behavior of individual legislators and the role that they play in crafting federal legislation in policy areas such as healthcare, civil rights and the environment. We will devote special attention to changes in Congress, as well as current political and scholarly controversies such as congressional confirmation process of Supreme Court justices, congressional war powers, the influence of parties, and campaign finance.

"POL","3319","Education and the American Dream","Twin Cities","What role does education play in American democracy? What role should it play? Does American education, particularly public education, live up to its citizens' hopes and expectations? And, perhaps most importantly, what do we mean by a ""good education""? This is a question with deep historical roots in this country, one that is the subject of current policy debates and one that cannot be separated from questions of discrimination and inequality. The over-arching theme of the course is to wrestle with what it means to be an educated citizen in the context of historical struggles to achieve that vision in the face of multiple and inter-related inequalities and competing visions about how to make the American dream a reality in the field of public education. No one political perspective will be offered or favored. No magic powder will be revealed on the last day of the course. The fact is that the underlying issues are really complicated, often seemingly intractable, and very, very political. This course is intended as introduction to education politics and policy in the United States. It will focus on K-12 education, especially in the public system. It is designed for any student who might have an interest in exploring education, public policy, or American government. Topics will include equality of educational opportunity, educating democratic citizens, school finance, the role of political institutions in making educational policy, and efforts to reform and remake American education, including charter schools, private school vouchers, and standardized testing. By the end of the course, students should have a basic understanding of the provision of public education in the United States, including the ways in which education is governed and the institutions involved in that governance. Students should be able to critically reflect on the degree to which American education fulfills the sometimes-competing goals Americans have for their schools. This course fulfills the Social Sciences Core of the University liberal education requirements. In this course students will act as policy analysts, with all of the complexity that such a task entails in the field of American public education.

Specifically, the course examines the complex role that federal, state, and local government plays in creating as well as addressing high rates of poverty, unemployment, violent crime, residential segregation, and under performing schools found in African American communities. Students will examine critically whether class-based policies such as Social Security, Medicaid, and unemployment insurance are more effective than race-based affirmative action policies in reducing the racial disparities between blacks and whites. Further, in discussions, the course will emphasize general concepts that recur in the readings and in other classes.

"POL","3435","Political Dynamics in the Horn of Africa","Twin Cities","Who wields political power? Who challenges those in power? And how do they legitimize their claims and go about enforcing them? These are the core questions that will guide our exploration of the political dynamics in the Horn of Africa. Just like most regions in Africa, the Horn is home to diverse cultures and languages. What distinguishes it, however, is the contested nature of state borders, which have been redrawn in ways not observed anywhere else in Africa since the end of European colonialism. The purpose of this class is to delve deeper into these conflicts, to examine the interactions between incumbent governments, armed rebel groups, and international actors in shaping war and peace in the Horn. Throughout this journey, we will pay special attention to ideas of sovereignty, identity, and violence and draw on literature outside of the Horn to help us better dissect what is going on within it.

Why have some countries in the post-colonial world, in particular, those of East Asia, experienced stunning economic growth, while those in other parts have not? We will explore inequality among nations through an engagement with competing explanations from multiple disciplines. Do free markets, the legacies of colonialism, state power, culture, or geography offer the most persuasive account of current patterns of global inequality? The course also examines what we mean by ""development"" and exposes students to cutting-edge debates in contemporary development studies.

"POL","3766","Political Psychology of Mass Behavior","Twin Cities","How do people develop their political opinions? What makes people vote the way that they do? Why do some people love, and other loathe, Donald Trump? Understanding how ordinary citizens engage with the political sphere is essential to understanding how politics work. This course applies a psychological approach to understanding how average people—members of the mass public—think about politics, make political decisions, and decide how (and whether) to take political actions. We will explore arguments about the role that ideology, biological and evolutionary factors, personality, identity and partisanship, racial attitudes, and political discussion play in shaping the opinion and behavior of members of the mass public. In addition, this class introduces students to the methodology of political psychology and how political psychologists approach questions and attempt to understand the political world.

Students will exit the class having mastered a body of knowledge about how they and their fellow citizens think about politics and the different approaches that scholars take to study these decisions. They will also gain the critical capacity to judge arguments about politics, the ability to identify, define, and solve problems, and the skill to locate and critically evaluate information relevant to these tasks. Finally, this course takes a cooperative approach to learning, and many course activities will be structured around learning and working with a group of fellow students over the course of the semester.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Every Fall & Spring"

This course examines the nature, measurement, and consequences of public opinion in the contemporary United States, with a particular emphasis on understanding why some voters preferred Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton - vice versa – in the 2016 presidential election. We’ll address the following questions throughout the term. First, how do pollsters measure what the public thinks about government and public affairs? Second, can we assume that the responses people give to survey questions reflect their true thoughts and feelings about politics? Third, what are the major factors that shape voter decision making in U.S. presidential elections?

"POL","3835","International Relations","Twin Cities","Why do countries go to war? Are individuals, organizations, and states driven by their interests or their ideas? What role does power play in international relations and is there any role for justice in global politics? Do international laws and transnational advocacy groups matter in a world dominated by powerful states? Whose interests are served by a globalizing world economy? These questions are central to the study of international relations, yet different theoretical approaches have been developed in an attempt to answer them. Often these approaches disagree with one another, leading to markedly different policy prescriptions and predictions for future events. This course provides the conceptual and theoretical means for analyzing these issues, processes, and events in international politics. By the end of this class, you will be able to understand the assumptions, the logics, and the implications of major theories and concepts of international relations. These include realism and neorealism, liberalism and liberal institutionalism, constructivism, feminism, Marxism, and critical theory.

An examination of these efforts begins in the Reconstruction Era and concludes with the historic election of the nation's first African American president. The course will cover topics such as the politics of the civil rights movement, black presidential bids and racialized voting in federal and state elections. Finally, the course examines how political parties and organized interests used the Voting Rights Act to increase the number of minorities in Congress. The course focuses on whether the growing number of minorities in Congress increases citizens' trust in government and their involvement in voting and participation in political organizations.","3","3","No","1","3","OPT - Student Option","-","Periodic Fall & Spring"

One hundred years from its inception, Islam spread to what is today Syria, Iraq, the Horn of Africa, North Africa, and across the Mediterranean Sea. Central Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and Anatolia (Turkey) came under the sway of Islam leading to the emergence of three major Islamic civilization that dominated and enlightened the old world for several centuries. This era came to an end with the rise of Capitalist Europe and its colonization of much of the world including Muslim societies.

"SLHS","1403","Neurodiversity and Communication","Twin Cities","Communication disorders are often considered a ""hidden"" disability. These disorders occur in children and adults due to a variety of causes and have negative influences on the person’s health and wellbeing. However, due to the lack of overt visibility they may go unnoticed until the person suffering from the impairment has an opportunity to express themselves, and in some instances this may not be possible. The limitations are compounded further when communication disorders are present in comorbidity with other conditions, including physical disabilities. Hence, the roles of stakeholders, including family members, healthcare professionals, and policy makers are important to enhance the quality of life of individuals with communication disorders. In this course, we will learn about concepts in the Disability Studies literature including ableism, intersectionality, neurodiversity, and the lived experiences of individuals with disabilities, and their applicability to communication disorders. The goal of the course is to provide students with foundational knowledge in disability studies as it relates to speech, language, and hearing sciences in comparison to other fields within disability studies. Through course readings we will focus on the lived experiences of individuals with disabilities and those of family members and health care professionals who work with individuals who experience Autism, Aphasia, Dyslexia, Hearing impairment, Stuttering, Speech disorders, or cognitive limitations.","3","3","No","1","3","A-F - A-F Grade Basis","-","Every Fall"
