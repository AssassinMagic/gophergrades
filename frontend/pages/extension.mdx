This tool is a great addition to any student's arsenal to help enrich their academic experience at the University of Minnesota. Available for Chrome and Firefox.

## Installation

For users on Chrome, you can install the extension by visiting the [Chrome Web Store](https://umn.lol/chrome) and clicking "Add to Chrome". For users on Firefox,

## Features

- Grade Distributions
- Class Locations
- Schedule Importing

### Grade Distributions

Grade distributions can be viewed on schedule builder directly on both the class pages and on your built schedules. This extension by default will
display the grade distributions for the overall course and the specific professor teaching the course if you're looking at a specific course given that there
is data available. On built schedules, navigating to the bottom of the page will display the overall grade distribution for all of your selected courses.

### Class Locations
*Chrome Only*. To view class locations navigate to a built schedule and click the "Map" button right above your displayed schedule. This will open a dropdown
with days of the week and a map. By selecting a day of the week, the map will display the locations of all of your classes on that day. These maps can be exported to
google maps and will even inform you if some of your classes are online.

### Schedule Importing
*Chrome Only*. To import your schedule into your calendar, navigate to your MyU classes page under the academics tab and find a week with courses.
Click the "Add Classes to Google Calendar" button and the extension will parse your courses. Once your courses are parsed you can change the colors for each course
and decide to either add the events to your calendar or download an .ics file to import into
other calendars.
